However, the gameplay is a major departure from said formula in one aspect: the introduction of Mario\u2019s hydro-pumping backpack, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3534\" href=\"/fludd/3005-3534\" slug=\"fludd\">  F.L.U.D.D.</a> <br/><br/>Mario utilizes F.L.U.D.D. throughout a majority of the game, and can apply it to a wide variety of different uses \u2013 most notably, the ability to Squirt objects and enemies that are due for a good rinse, as well as the ability to hover, which allows for a safe recovery from dangerous falls, and provides the aptitude to reach previously inaccessible areas.<br/><br/> <h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340179-sms_mario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340179\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2714/340179-sms_mario.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340179\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2714/340179-sms_mario.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Mario with the water-blasting backpack, F.L.U.D.D.</figcaption></figure>Super Mario Sunshine has gameplay similar to previous Super Mario game, Super Mario 64. As with every <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177\" slug=\"mario\">  Mario</a> game, however, it adds new gameplay aspects and features. Likely the most important upgrade is the addition of F.L.U.D.D. (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device). F.L.U.D.D. is a pack that Mario wears that can either spray water or use water power to have Mario hover. Other nozzles can be unlocked later: the Rocket Nozzle and the Turbo Nozzle. The Rocket Nozzle can shoot Mario several hundred feet into the air. The Turbo Nozzle can allow Mario to run at incredible speeds, even allowing him to run on water and break through thing s like doors.<br/><br/>Mario can also enlist the aid of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700\" slug=\"yoshi\">  Yoshi</a>. When riding Yoshi, he can eat enemies, fruit, and even birds. Some of the birds grant a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1984\" href=\"/shine-sprite/3055-1984\" slug=\"shine-sprite\">Shine Sprite</a> upon being eaten, while others give coins. After eating fruit, Yoshi can spit juice from the fruit. This juice can dissolve large orange blocks, which are obstacles blocking certain secret areas. The juice can also turn enemies into platforms. Based on the type of fruit, the color and effect of the juice are different. Yoshi can die in two ways that Mario can't: without eating fruit, Yoshi will die, and when Yoshi touches the water, he dies.<br/> <br/> The primary goal of Super Mario Sunshine is to collect Shine Sprites. These are in a variety of smaller levels, from the hub world of Delfino Plaza. Each Shine Sprite can be acquired by doing a specific task in the level. Every level has eight such tasks to be completed. After collecting a large enough amount of Shine Sprites, a new level is unlocked, Mario gets a new ability, or an event related to the plot. Shine Sprites can be collected in other ways, such as gathering enough blue coins (scattered around <a data-ref-id=\"3035-494\" href=\"/isle-delfino/3035-494\" slug=\"isle-delfino\">  Isle Delfino</a>) or eating certain birds. Not all Shine Sprites need to be acquired in order to gain access to the final level; only Shadow Mario related events.<br/><br/> <h2>Plot</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13933/494416-super_mario_sunshine_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494416\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.74857142857143\" data-width=\"350\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13933/494416-super_mario_sunshine_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494416\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13933/494416-super_mario_sunshine_3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13933/494416-super_mario_sunshine_3.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure>The game opens with Mario, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709\" slug=\"princess-peach\">  Princess Peach</a>, and several of the Princess' <a data-ref-id=\"3005-845\" href=\"/toad/3005-845\" slug=\"toad\">  royal entourage</a> aboard a private plane, en route to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-494\" href=\"/isle-delfino/3035-494\" slug=\"isle-delfino\">  Isle Delfino</a>, a destination that everyone believes will be a tranquil escape from the every day grind of kidnappings, fire-breathing behemoths, and general mayhem that makes the Mushroom Kingdom such an unproductive working environment.

However, this time it's not the Sacred Realm that has been corrupted by Ganon's evil wishes and turned into the Dark World. In A Link Between Worlds, this other place is called Lorule and is a land fallen upon dark times which used to be a lot like Hyrule. Lorule is governed by Princess Hilda, the direct counterpart to Zelda in Hyrule. Hilda is in need of a Hero to save Lorule but there is no one suitable around. Possible connections between Hilda and Yuga are still unclear as is the role of Ganon in Link's nightmares.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>A Link Between Worlds represents a major initiative to throw out many of the design conventions of the Zelda series and approach the basic game structure differently. The development team pushed for a more open, player driven experience in contrast to other recent Zelda titles. Instead the gameplay goes for a more open-ended approach, reminiscent of the original <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">Legend of Zelda</a>.</p><h3>Playing with Perspective</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2560431\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2560431-3ds_zeldalbw_1001_21.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2560431-3ds_zeldalbw_1001_21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2560431\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2560431-3ds_zeldalbw_1001_21.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2560431-3ds_zeldalbw_1001_21.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>The game is presented from the traditional top-down perspective of early Zelda titles such as A Link to the Past and <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening/3030-3645\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3645\">Link's Awakening</a>. However, gameplay and exploration are centered around playing with perspective, as <a href=\"/link/3005-191\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a> is able to flatten himself into a wall sketch so he can move on walls like a shadow. When Link is in this state, the camera perspective shifts to provide a three-dimensional side view of the immediate environment.</p><h3>Renting Items</h3><p>The biggest and most important new addition to the game is the item renting systems. In an effort to combat the linearity of recent Zeldas, players now get to rent all the major puzzle items from Ravio's shop.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2526441\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2526441-zlcfzrfgevspn8uhme.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2526441-zlcfzrfgevspn8uhme.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2526441\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2526441-zlcfzrfgevspn8uhme.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2526441-zlcfzrfgevspn8uhme.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Ravio offers Link the opportunity to rent items for an affordable price as long as he wants or until he dies. In the event that Link meets an untimely end in a dungeon or facing off against an enemy, the little flying creature that accompanies Ravio will collect all the rented items and return them to the shop. When that happens, the item has to be rented again. Purchasing items is an option as well, though the price to own an item forever is quite steep. This places an unprecedented importance on rupees in this new Zelda game.

However, some notable changes have been made in the form of new passages that function as shortcuts between major locations and the addition of the aforementioned new mini-dungeons and caves that hide various treasures for Link to find.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2553667\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2553667-10039240013_957af328cc_o.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2553667-10039240013_957af328cc_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2553667\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2553667-10039240013_957af328cc_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2553667-10039240013_957af328cc_o.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Another factor changing the way players perceive and explore the familiar Hyrule landscape is the wall-merge mechanic that turns Link into a flat painting. Just as it is used in dungeons to solve puzzles, it is used in the overworld to reach otherwise inaccessible places. On top of that, it is used to travel through tears \"between worlds\" and cross over into Lorule. This can again be used to reach different places previously not reachable by Link.</p><p>Getting around the world quickly is again facilitated by the familiar fast travel system from A Link to the Past by way of calling the witch Irene with a bell after which she will drop Link off at already discovered weather vanes like the one next to Ravio's shop.</p><h2>Items</h2><h3>New Items</h3><h4>Tornado Rod</h4><p>Used to produce an updraft so Link can reach higher places. Also has offensive use.</p><h4>Sand Rod</h4><p>Manipulates sand to form solid ground for Link to walk on or wall-merge in to.</p><h4>Yellow Potion</h4><p>Makes Link invulnerable for a brief period. Requirements: Yellow Monster Horn</p><h4>Purple Potion</h4><p>Damages enemies around Link. Requirements: Purple Enemy Guts</p><h4>Energy Potion</h4><p>Can be found in pots. Instantly refills the energy meter.</p><h4>Hint Glass</h4><p>The Hint Glass lets Link see hint ghosts that help Link solve puzzles if necessary. However, usage requires payment via 3DS Play Coins. Each hint costs 1 coin.</p><h4>Ravio's Bracelet</h4><p>Ravio's Bracelet is given to Link by Ravio and has multiple uses in this game. The most important being the ability to turn Link into a painting so he can walk along walls in his flat state. Another key function is that it activates the energy meter that determines the frequency with which players can use items before having to wait for a recharge.</p><h4>Foul Fruit</h4><p>This fruit can be purchased at the shop in Kakariko Village. It can be used to scare off or stun enemies.</p><h4>Scoot Fruit</h4><p>This fruit can also be purchased at the shop in Kakariko Village. It allows Link to warp out of dungeons.</p><h3>Known returning items</h3><ul><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/bow/3055-73\" data-ref-id=\"3055-73\">Bow</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/boomerang/3055-76\" data-ref-id=\"3055-76\">Boomerang</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/bomb/3055-97\" data-ref-id=\"3055-97\">Bombs</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/hook-shot/3055-383\" data-ref-id=\"3055-383\">Hookshot</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/hammer/3055-308\" data-ref-id=\"3055-308\">Hammer</a></li><li>Fire Rod</li><li>Ice Rod</li><li>Red Potion (Heals eight hearts) - Requirements: Rupees</li><li>Blue Potion (Full health refill) - Requirements: Rupees, Blue Enemy Guts</li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/lantern/3055-1978\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1978\">Lantern</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/butterfly-net/3055-2667\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2667\">Net</a></li><li><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/bottle/3055-133\" data-ref-id=\"3055-133\">Bottle</a></li><li>Zora Flippers</li><li><a href=\"/power-glove/3055-3532\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3532\">Power Gloves</a></li><li><a href=\"/pegasus-boots/3055-4913\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4913\">Pegasus Boots</a></li></ul><h3>Finding Maiamai &amp; Upgrading Items</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2560127\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2560127-3ds_zeldalbw_comiccon_screenshot_06.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.61057692307692\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2560127-3ds_zeldalbw_comiccon_screenshot_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2560127\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2560127-3ds_zeldalbw_comiccon_screenshot_06.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2560127-3ds_zeldalbw_comiccon_screenshot_06.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Items can be upgraded by finding Maiamais all over the world (100 in total) and returning a certain amount of them to the Mother Maiamai which will then reward Link with an upgrade for an item the player has purchased (not rented!) from Ravio's shop. Maiamais are stuck to walls (some in easily visible places, others must be located by following their cries) and can only be removed by using the wall-merge mechanic and getting behind them in order to pop them off the wall. Mother Maiamai can be found in both Hyrule and Lorule. An important detail is the fact that only items purchased from Ravio can be upgraded. Rented items are not eligible.</p><h3>Other Collectibles</h3><p>Finding Maiamai, heart pieces and collecting rupees is not the only thing Link spends his time on when not solving puzzles and fighting baddies. The latter will drop objects like guts, horns or tails which Link can use to trade for potions at the Witch's hut. These potions aren't limited to restorative functions like in previous Zelda games. They can be used to damage surrounding enemies, make Link invulnerable or heal him.</p><h3>Replenishing Resources</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2560532\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2560532-triplebow.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2560532-triplebow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2560532\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2560532-triplebow.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2560532-triplebow.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The gauge on the left depletes as Link uses items and skills.</figcaption></figure><p>In A Link Between Worlds, collecting arrows or replenishing Link's bomb supply is a thing of the past as there is a new system in place similar to the stamina gauge from Skyward Sword. This allows Link to, for example, fire arrows until the gauge is fully depleted after which it has to refill before Link can continue to shoot arrows. All item usage and the wall-merge ability is tied to this mechanic, limiting Link's ability to mindlessly spam item attacks.</p><h2>Dungeons</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2570229\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2570229-10840750476_8a3cd41f04_o.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.61057692307692\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2570229-10840750476_8a3cd41f04_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2570229\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2570229-10840750476_8a3cd41f04_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2570229-10840750476_8a3cd41f04_o.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Evil ducks look even more evil.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's structure is loosely based on that of A Link to the Past in that there are four basic dungeons in Hyrule and another eight in Lorule. Only the first dungeon has to be completed before the player can freely choose the order in which to approach the remaining dungeons as all items necessary can be purchased or rented from Ravio's shop. Key items needed in a dungeon are telegraphed via a symbol at the dungeon entrance to avoid frustrating experiences.</p><p>Familiar dungeons from A Link to the Past are revisited and appear in new light just like the overworld due to changes in the environment and other changes brought on by the passage of time since the original game.</p><h2>Mini-Games</h2><p>As is typical for the Zelda series, there are a few mini-games available for Link to partake in with the chance to win some cash or heart pieces.

Striving to make his kingdom the best it could be, he enlisted the help of the <a href=\"../../the-nexus/95-2211/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nexus</a> - a great tower harboring the souls of the dead. King Allant used the Soul Arts to improve life in Boletaria, making it prosper beyond its previous limits.</p><p>With time, King Allant was still unsatisfied. He demanded more. He knew where the greatest power of all was to be held. He took it upon himself to delve beneath the Nexus and awake the great being below, \" <a href=\"../../the-old-one/94-16895/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Old One</a>\". It was a being of indescribable hunger, a being which feeds on the souls of the dead, growing hungrier and craving more powerful souls with every soul it devours.</p><p>With the awakening of <a href=\"/the-old-one/3005-16895\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16895\">The Old One</a>, Boletaria began to be enveloped in a great fog. The fog spread outward, blanketing Boletaria in a haze of death. No man or woman who passed within the borders of the fog were ever seen again. Worse than that, the fog still grows, and if not stopped, will consume all in existence.</p><p>Warriors from all over were drawn to the fog. People seeking wealth, fame, power, and repentance all flocked to Boletaria. And yet the fog still grows.</p><p>The player takes on the role of a adventurer, crossing into the fog of Boletaria.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>When starting a new character, the player chooses a gender and a place of origin (North, South, East, or West) and is able to <a href=\"/customizable-characters/3015-155\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">fine-tune</a> the character's appearance using a system of sliders.</p><p>The player must also select a <a href=\"/classes/3015-405\" data-ref-id=\"3015-405\">class</a> of sorts - however, classes in Demon's Souls are less concrete than in most other RPGs, serving more as examples of the various approaches the player might eventually decide on. The starting class only affects starting stats, gear, and - if applicable - magic spells. Any player can use any weapon, armor, ring, or magic regardless of initial class choice (though a few pieces of equipment are gender-specific.) The use of weapons, armor and magic is governed only by stat requirements, and rings have no restrictions.</p><p>Those who want to use magic or miracles must first attain at least 10 in both Intelligence and Magic before \"Wizard\" spells can be learned, and a 10 in Faith before miracles can be learned. Casting spells or miracles requires a Catalyst or a Talisman, respectively.</p><h3>Classes</h3><ul><li><b>Soldier:</b> (Soul Level 6) The default class, a balanced character geared for melee combat with no particular weaknesses or strengths. Starts with a set of plate armor, a broadsword, and a spear.</li><li><b>Knight</b>: (Soul Level 4) Physically strong and heavily armored, with the best starting shield, but lacking in Vitality compared to other melee classes. The bulky starting armor also greatly reduces mobility.</li><li><b>Hunter</b>: (Soul Level 6) A balanced character that is equipped with a bow, a one-handed <a href=\"/battle-axe/3055-2214\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2214\">battle axe</a>, a shield, and and leather armor.</li><li><b>Priest</b>: (Soul Level 6) A warrior of the light. Starts with a healing miracle, a mace, and chain armor.</li><li><b>Magician</b>: (Soul Level 6) A strong user of fire magic. Weak in physical offense and defense, and very little armor at the outset.</li><li><b>Wanderer</b>: (Soul Level 6) Melee fighter that specializes in lighter armor and Dexterity-based weapons.</li><li><b>Barbarian</b>: (Soul Level 9) Physically powerful with very high HP, but only comes equipped with two clubs and no armor. Has the highest starting soul level, tied with the Thief.</li><li><b>Thief</b>: (Soul Level 9) Lightly armed with a dagger and Dark Leather armor. Starts with very high Luck and Dexterity, along with a high Soul Level.</li><li><b>Temple Knight:</b> (Soul Level 4) A holy warrior who wields a halberd and casts healing miracles. Comes exceptionally well-armored with a suit of Mirdan Scale.</li><li><b>Royalty</b>: (Soul Level 1) Usually considered the easiest starting class. Lacking in stats, but has very rare starting gear such as an MP-regenerating ring, and can cast a fairly powerful, easy-to-use attack spell (Soul Arrow). The low Soul Level is also helpful to experienced players, as it allows more control over stat progression.</li></ul><h3><b>Starting Class Stats</b></h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Class</th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-vitality\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vit</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-endurance\" rel=\"nofollow\">End</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-strength\" rel=\"nofollow\">Str</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-dexterity\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dex</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-magic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-faith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Faith</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-luck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luck</a></th><th><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-slvl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starting</a><br /><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stat-slvl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soul Level</a></th></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/soldier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soldier</a></td><td>14</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/knight\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knight</a></td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/hunter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hunter</a></td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/priest\" rel=\"nofollow\">Priest</a></td><td>13</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/magician\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magician</a></td><td>9</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>15</td><td>6</td><td>11</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/wanderer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderer</a></td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/barbarian\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barbarian</a></td><td>15</td><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thief</a></td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>14</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/temple-knight\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple Knight</a></td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>12</td><td>6</td><td>13</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/royalty\" rel=\"nofollow\">Royalty</a></td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>12</td><td>7</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/876601-demon63.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876601\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.560546875\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/876601-demon63.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876601\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/876601-demon63.jpg\"/></a></figure><p>Demon's Souls plays a bit differently from most other <a href=\"../../hack-and-slash/92-469/\" rel=\"nofollow\">hack'n'slash</a> games. The combat system seems rather basic at first, but is very intuitive. It shows itself to be very intricate and robust, allowing for immense flexibility to adjust to the individual's play style.</p><ul><li>The player can do a light attack, heavy attack, <a href=\"../../block/92-1843/\" rel=\"nofollow\">block</a>, <a href=\"../../parrying/92-2485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">parry</a>, <a href=\"../../backstab/92-3236/\" rel=\"nofollow\">backstab</a>, <a href=\"../../riposte/92-4316/\" rel=\"nofollow\">riposte</a>, and a dodging-roll - all behaving differently based on what equipment the player currently has on.</li><li>Crossbows can be shot at range, while bows allow faster shooting and the option of manual first-person aiming.</li><li>The player can cast a range of <a href=\"../../evocation/92-5737/\" rel=\"nofollow\">offensive</a> and defensive magic spells with catalysts, and ask for miracles from <a href=\"../../god/94-7315/\" rel=\"nofollow\">God</a> to <a href=\"../../health/92-130/\" rel=\"nofollow\">heal</a>, <a href=\"../../protector/92-2468/\" rel=\"nofollow\">protect</a>, or attack with talismans.</li><li>To defeat demons, the player must learn to use the right weapon against the right enemy. Enemies each have unique weaknesses to certain attacks, spells, and usable items, while being strongly resistant to others. It is not wise to attack an armored enemy with a blade, nor is it efficient to use fire attacks on enemies made out of fire.</li></ul><h2>Game Areas</h2><ul><li><a href=\"../../the-nexus/95-2211/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Nexus</a>: Hub world, from which to access the 5 other worlds. Contains helpful <a href=\"../../non-player-character/92-967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPC</a>s that sell items, upgrade weapons and let you level up. In here you are also totally safe from Black Phantoms.</li><li><a href=\"../../boletarian-palace/95-2207/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boletarian Palace</a> (World 1). Uniquely divided into 4 sections, as opposed to 3. Once the Palace of King Allant, it is now overrun by ghoulish humanoids and fierce Red- and Blue Eyed Knights. It is also home to two fire-breathing dragons, raining death from above. Deep within the Palace you can find <a href=\"/yuria-the-witch/3005-11180\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11180\">Yuria the Witch</a>.</li><li><a href=\"../../stonefang-tunnel/95-2208/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stonefang Tunnel</a> (World 2). A network of mines, guarded by bosses that favor flame attacks. Best bring fire protection! Also contains a nest of <a href=\"../../crystal-gecko/92-3319/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crystal Geckos</a>. Home also to the immensely helpful <a href=\"../../blacksmith-ed/94-11182/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blacksmith Ed</a>. Most enemies here use the same style of attack and have the same weaknesses, so equipment strategies are best worked out here.</li><li><a href=\"../../tower-of-latria/95-2209/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tower of Latria</a> (World 3). A prison tower. A cruel, inhospitable place rising up above a swamp. Powerful magical sentries guard the halls, with the upper spires the domain of evil gargoyles. <a href=\"../../sage-freke/94-11184/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage Freke</a> is imprisoned here. This world is not a place to learn how to fight, but rather a place to hone your skills once you've learned the controls and mechanics of your character.</li><li><a href=\"../../shrine-of-storms/95-2210/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shrine of Storms</a> (World 4). An ancient mausoleum and burial ground surrounded by jagged, wind-swept cliffs. Home to agile skeletons, cruel Reapers that summon wraiths, and the occasional flying manta ray (Be ready to dodge as these like to attack you randomly). Within its bowels you may find <a href=\"../../saint-urbain/94-11196/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saint Urbain</a>.</li><li><a href=\"../../valley-of-defilement/95-2212/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valley of Defilement</a> (World 5). Possibly the most dangerous place of all, where the very environment is hostile. An atmosphere of decrepitude, decay, disease, and constant rain. Enemies include corrupted humanoids, insects, rats, and worse. Poison and plague are a common hazard here. Not for the inexperienced. Fire is helpful through most of this world.</li></ul><h3>Soul Form and Body Form</h3><p>At the start of the game, the player is in Soul form. In Soul form, the player has 50% of his total HP (75% with a ring found early on in the first level, the Cling Ring) but deals more damage to enemies. By killing a Boss, the player regains their body. In addition to having full HP and dealing less damage, the player can then also summon other players as Blue Phantoms to help him. However, the player can also be invaded by malicious Black Phantoms, other players that try to kill you. So if you want to prevent this, you'll have to stay in Soul Form. Additionally, when in Body Form, dying will cause a shift of World Tendency towards Black (explained later). Killing a Boss will result in a shift of World Tendency towards White.</p><h3>Souls</h3><p>Souls are the universal form of currency in the game. They are used for buying items, upgrading weapons and levelling up your character. Every enemy killed grants Souls, as does killing a Boss. You can also find Souls as items which you can use to gain a fixed amount of Souls. When you die in either Form, the Souls you were carrying are dropped where you died. You can then try to pick them up again, but should you die again before picking them up, those Souls are gone forever. In short, you can only regain the Souls you dropped the last time you died. Boss Demons have unique Souls which can be used to upgrade weapons, learn unique Magic or Miracles, or all of the above, so you'll have to make some tough decisions.</p><p>Below is a table listing each world's bosses in their likely order of appearance, the souls which they drop when slain, and the possible uses of each soul. Note that every soul can be consumed for souls if not used for another purpose.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>World</th><th>Boss</th><th>Soul</th><th>Uses</th></tr><tr><td><b>Tutorial</b></td><td><a href=\"../../vanguard/94-11215/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vanguard</a>*</td><td><a href=\"../../grey-demons-soul/93-2150/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grey Demon's Soul</a></td><td>Dozer Axe weapon;

A character has a limit to the weight of his currently equipped gear, which you can increase by raising your Endurance statistic. When you are over half of that limit, your movement will be somewhat sluggish and you won't be able to roll nimbly. On the flipside, heavier armor provides more protection.</p><p>Stamina is what is used for all your actions. Sprinting, attacking, rolling, defending, everything costs stamina. When you're out of stamina your only option is to simply run. Stamina regenerates fast, however the heavier your armor, the slower it regenerates. Stamina can also be increased by leveling your Endurance stat, though this benefit stops after Endurance 40. Equipment weight has a big impact on how your character plays. Bigger, heavier weapons are also slower to use and cost more stamina to swing, but do more damage.</p><h3>World Tendency</h3><p>Starting out, each world has a neutral tendency. By killing bosses or Black Phantoms, you can shift the tendency towards White, and by dying in Body Form or killing helpful NPC's, you shift it towards Black. By reaching Pure Black or Pure White World Tendency, specific events are unlocked, such as doors opening or Unique weapons appearing. Some characters may turn up and either offer you side quests, or try to kill you, depending on Tendency. Also it effects the challenge of the game itself as well as drop rates. The whiter the tendency the players HP is penalized less in soul form and the player does more damage and drop rates increase on healing items, the blacker the tendency the enemies hit harder but release more souls on death and drop rates increase on rare items.</p><p>Note that World Tendency is affected by multiplayer, which is the server's median and changes depending on what others are doing. An example: If a majority of the players in the game are doing things in the world to change their tendency to black, this will affect the median appropriately, and likewise for white. The server median is based on sessions, so once you quit the game, the server median tendency is lost to you. It should also be noted that if you play online it will reset your World Tendencies to one level below White, so if you plan to do the Pure World Tendency events you should play the game offline by not logging into PSN.</p><h3>Character Tendency</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1401753-tendency.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401753\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1401753-tendency.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401753\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17388/1401753-tendency.jpg\"/></a></figure><p>Similar to World Tendency, certain actions will shift the tendency of your own character. Killing invading Black Phantoms or using the Resurrection spell on Blue Phantoms will bring you closer towards white , while killing certain NPC's or assassinating other players as a Black Phantom will shift you towards Black. Some weapons deal bonus damage based on your tendency, and you can earn unique rings for either Pure Black or Pure White Tendency. Lastly there is also a special NPC that only becomes available when a characters tendency is pure Black and certain extra conditions are met.</p><h3>New Game+</h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Lifecycle</th><th>Game Difficulty</th><th>Compared to NG</th></tr><tr><td>NG</td><td>Game difficulty has no modifier.</td><td>+ 0%</td></tr><tr><td>NG+</td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 40% compared to NG (Neutral <a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT</a> assumed)</td><td>+ 40%</td></tr><tr><td>NG++</td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG+ (Neutral <a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT</a> assumed)</td><td>+ 51.2 %</td></tr><tr><td>NG+++</td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG++ (Neutral <a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT</a> assumed)</td><td>+ 63.3 %</td></tr><tr><td>NG4+</td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG+++ (Neutral <a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT</a> assumed)</td><td>+ 76.4 %</td></tr><tr><td>NG5+</td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG4+ (Neutral <a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT</a> assumed)</td><td>+ 90.5 %</td></tr><tr><td>NG6+</td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG5+ (Neutral <a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT</a> assumed)</td><td>+ 105.7 %</td></tr><tr><td>NG7+</td><td>Difficulty increased by approximate 8% compared to NG6+ (Neutral <a href=\"http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/character-tendency\" rel=\"nofollow\">CT</a> assumed)</td><td>+ 122.2 %</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Note:</strong> From the 8th playthrough onwards, the difficulty will not increase.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>The game has a somewhat unique implementation of both player-versus-player and cooperative <a href=\"../../multiplayer-party-system/92-939/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiplayer</a>. When in Body Form, the player can summon other players as Blue Phantoms to help, and other players can even jump into your game as black phantoms and try to assassinate you. At one point in the game a certain boss may even be replaced by a black phantom. To play in co-op mode you use your Blue Eye Stone while you are in Soul Form to create a blue soul sign which living players can see and interact with to summon you. To invade the game of a player in Body form you use your Black Eye Stone while you are in Soul form. Lastly there is a special Red Eye Stone that works exactly like the Blue Eye Stone except when you are summoned you are a Black Phantom, this stone is primarily used for organizing duels. The Red Eye Stone has two other unique traits, it is the only stone that can be used to create a soul sign when the player is in body form (your HP if summoned will revert to soul forum levels), and anyone killed by someone summoned via the Red Eye Stone will lose a level; likewise the Black Phantom summoned this way also loses a level if they die regardless of how it happens.</p><h3>Online</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1401767-message.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401767\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.61666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17388/1401767-message.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1401767\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17388/1401767-message.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17388/1401767-message.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Trap ahead.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>One host can summon up to 2 players to play <a href=\"../../cooperative-play/92-108/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cooperatively</a> in most sections of the game.</li><li>There is a thorough messaging system that allows players to leave hints, advice, or even tricks meant to help or deceive others.

The focus of the game's story is the Kid's quest to create a safe haven, known as <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3776\" href=\"/the-bastion/3035-3776\">the Bastion</a>. The rest of the world has become a series of floating islands after the Calamity.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Bastion is an action RPG with a level structure that emphasizes fast paced and frantic gameplay. The Kid moves through fantasy-themed environments that form up underneath his feet as he moves thorough each level. In order to progress, the Kid must defeat enemies using a variety of melee and ranged weaponry while collecting items and leveling up his attributes with experience points along the way. There is a currency in Bastion known as fragments, or pieces of the Old World. They are found laying about in the different environments and are dropped by enemies upon defeat. Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where he can use the fragments he has acquired to purchase weapon upgrades and spirits. These spirits alter and enhance the Kid's abilities in a number of different ways. Depending on the level of the character, players can \"equip\" more spirits and therefore give themselves a greater advantage in battle.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/35/1638270-bastion_112010_0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638270\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/35/1638270-bastion_112010_0001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638270\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/35/1638270-bastion_112010_0001.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Fighting a Scumbag, one of the unique monsters in Bastion</figcaption></figure><p>The game incorporates a unique feature called 'dynamic narration'. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-19712\" href=\"/rucks/3005-19712\">Rucks</a>, the strange old man (voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-99847\" href=\"/logan-cunningham/3040-99847\">Logan Cunningham</a>), serves as the game's narrator. As well as delivering story exposition, Rucks' narration will change based on the player's actions and style of play - for example, he might remark upon the player's affinity for a certain weapon if said weapon is used frequently during battle, or he might comment on an enemy that the player is about to fight.</p><p>Aside from the main locations that the player visits throughout the progression of the main story, there are also optional challenge levels for each weapon.

Rucks is the first character that the Kid meets, although he is only referred to as The Stranger until the two of them officially introduce themselves. Rucks knows a lot about the Bastion and the Calamity, and throughout the game he fills in the history of Caelondia, the Calamity, and the history between the Caelondians and the Ura. He also knows the back-stories for the other two characters, Zulf and Zia, and tells them during the Kid's trips to Who Knows Where.</p><h3><a data-ref-id=\"3005-19716\" href=\"/zia/3005-19716\">Zia</a> (The Singer)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7021/1845727-zia2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1845727\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 172px\" data-ratio=\"1.7441860465116\" data-width=\"172\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7021/1845727-zia2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1845727\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7021/1845727-zia2.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7021/1845727-zia2.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Zia</figcaption></figure><p>Zia is special in that she is a Ura who was actually born in Caelondia.

Zulf survived the Calamity and is found by the Kid in the center of The Hanging Gardens, who welcomes him into the Bastion. Zulf befriends the survivors, but things eventually go sour. Zulf learns from an old diary the truth about the Calamity. In his ensuing rage, he damages the Bastion and flees. By the time the Kid successfully restores the Bastion, Zulf has already rallied the remaining Ura to rebel against the Bastion and the survivors. They don't realize that the Bastion has the potential to undo the destruction.</p><p>Zulf's \"Who Knows Where\" level is available late in the game through a bedroll that Rucks finds.</p><h3><b>Weapons</b></h3><p>New weapons are found as the player progresses through the game's main story. The Kid can also equip one special attack, called a Secret Skill, which is used by pressing the right trigger. These attacks are usually weapon specific and drain a single Black Tonic on use. Players can find additional Secret Skills by completing weapon challenges with high scores, or purchasing them from the Lost-and-Found.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-border\"><thead><tr><th>Weapon Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Related Secret Skills</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/2178293-army_carbine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2178293\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 94px\" data-ratio=\"0.8936170212766\" data-width=\"94\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14440/2178293-army_carbine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2178293\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/2178293-army_carbine.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14440/2178293-army_carbine.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Army Carbine</figcaption></figure></td><td>Powerful long range weapon.

After receiving this feedback, the team hired <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98300\" href=\"/jen-zee/3040-98300\">Jen Zee</a> to create the game's artwork.

The voice work for the narration was performed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-99847\" href=\"/logan-cunningham/3040-99847\">Logan Cunningham</a> and recorded by Darren Korb.

The game was released on the 3DS <a href=\"/3dsware/3045-138\" data-ref-id=\"3045-138\">eShop</a> on December 22, 2011. An updated version featuring re-drawn sprites and system-specific features like <a href=\"/off-tv-play/3015-7482\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7482\">Off-TV Play</a> was released on the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> eShop as Mighty Switch Force HD on November 18, 2012, in time for the console's North American launch.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mighty Switch Force is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player, as <a href=\"/patricia-wagon/3005-21978\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21978\">Patricia Wagon</a>, must run, jump and shoot their way through levels in order to capture five escaped criminals. After the player collects all five criminals in the level, they need to locate Corporal Gendarmor in order to complete the stage. A radar displayed on the touch screen points toward the nearest prisoner/exit.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2077807-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2077807\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2077807-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2077807\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97089/2077807-6.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Patty taking out an enemy.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">What makes Mighty Switch Force unique to its genre is the added ability to switch panels between the foreground and background at will. Panel switching is used for both traversing the environment and disposing of enemies. If an enemy (or the player) is standing in front of a background block when it is switched to the foreground, they are slammed into the front of the 3DS screen. Other blocks serve to propel the player and enemies in a particular direction; these blocks can be used in conjunction with the other panels to dispose of enemies or navigate to seemingly inaccessible areas of the stage. Another type of panel adding wrinkles to the gameplay is one which does not recede into the background when the player is standing on it and press the switch button. This allows players to have control over the patterns of panels as they switch back and forth, leading to more complex puzzles.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Each stage features a par time to beat, though completing a stage under the par time is not required in order to progress. Players can revisit any previously-beaten stage to try and beat the par time. Finishing under par leaves a little mark next to the stage number in the level select screen to indicate that players have achieved this feat.</p><h2>DLC</h2><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2212149-release_msf_new_levels.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2212149\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1750599520384\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97089/2212149-release_msf_new_levels.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2212149\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97089/2212149-release_msf_new_levels.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>DLC Advertisement</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the outset, Mighty Switch Force was released with 16 \"incidents\".

Retro Studio's trademark 60 frames per second gameplay also makes a return with the added benefit of a native 720p resolution this time.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606156\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606156-4871667520-wiiu_.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606156-4871667520-wiiu_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606156\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2606156-4871667520-wiiu_.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong does not have to enter dimly lit ice caves alone.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tropical Freeze includes more more dynamic, three-dimensional levels than those that appeared in Donkey Kong Country Returns and also brings back underwater stages (which haven't been seen since <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong-country-3-dixie-kongs-double-trouble/3030-4547\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4547\">Donkey Kong Country 3</a>). Levels now often feature multiple gameplay styles such as platforming mixed with underwater segments or rocket/mine cart segments instead of being limited to levels solely dedicated to one gameplay type. Players can choose to play as <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong/3005-299\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/diddy-kong/3005-304\" data-ref-id=\"3005-304\">Diddy Kong</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dixie-kong/3005-303\" data-ref-id=\"3005-303\">Dixie Kong</a>, and for the first time in the series, <a href=\"/cranky-kong/3005-311\" data-ref-id=\"3005-311\">Cranky Kong</a>. Like the previous title, Tropical Freeze supports a local two-player mode with player one taking the role of Donkey and player two getting the chance to chose between the three support characters.</p><h4>Diddy Kong</h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">All support characters have unique abilities with Diddy again bringing his trusty jetpack that lets him float a short distance in the air, just like in the previous title. On top of that, the jetpack provides a speed boost when using it underwater, making Diddy the fastest swimmer. Diddy retains his signature cartwheel animation when \"rolling\" forward and carries objects on front of him. His support weapon is again the peanut gun which, like all the other characters' support weapons, will stun enemies.</p><h4>Dixie Kong</h4><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606318\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606318-iclxdkbp0mpqb.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606318-iclxdkbp0mpqb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606318\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2606318-iclxdkbp0mpqb.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2606318-iclxdkbp0mpqb.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Still one of the most powerful hair dos in gaming.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While Dixie Kong makes use of her pony tail as she did in her appearances in DKC 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and DKC 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble, this time it allows her to execute a quasi double-jump by twirling her hair mid-jump to briefly gain extra height. Dixie's pony tail also comes in handy when swimming against strong currents underwater since she can use it like a rotor to propel herself forward slowly but steadily. In this game, Dixie no longer carries objects like barrels with her pony tail above her head but instead just uses her hands and carries it in front of her. Her \"rolling\" animation is her classic pirouette with the hair spin. Dixie's support weapon is the bubble gum popgun.</p><h4>Cranky Kong</h4><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2580928\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2580928-9d68bf313df265376b998af6bd16b20f9a4afd04.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2580928-9d68bf313df265376b998af6bd16b20f9a4afd04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2580928\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2580928-9d68bf313df265376b998af6bd16b20f9a4afd04.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2580928-9d68bf313df265376b998af6bd16b20f9a4afd04.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Scrooge McDuck and Cranky Kong would probably not get along very well.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Cranky Kong does not have an ability that grants him extended air time, however he uses his can to bounce around which lets him jump higher. This also enables him to jump on spikes or enemies that would otherwise harm him. Combining his cane bounce with a roll lets him move extremely fast while making it very tough to navigate safely through levels. In underwater segments, he can use his cane as a melee weapon to damage objects or enemies that are in the way. Cranky is now the character carrying objects above his head since he needs one hand to hold his cane. His support weapon comes in the form of dentures the throws around.</p><h3>Various Mechanics</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tropical Freeze brings back another mechanic from the past, this time being from producer <a href=\"/kensuke-tanabe/3040-35535\" data-ref-id=\"3040-35535\">Kensuke Tanabe</a>'s very first game: <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-bros-2/3030-7406\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7406\">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>. Donkey Kong &amp; company are are now able to pluck things from the ground to reveal items, much like <a href=\"/mario/3005-177\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and his fellow adventurers did, or alter the environment to open new or previously blocked paths.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606150\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606150-8483089867-wiiu_.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606150-8483089867-wiiu_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606150\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2606150-8483089867-wiiu_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2606150-8483089867-wiiu_.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Imagine this screen had one heart less.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Additional, climbing and swinging from vines, grabbing onto grass hanging on ceilings and walls and destroying certain objects in the environment by pounding on the ground is often required of the Kongs. Throwing objects or enemies now is a bigger part of the game, too with secrets and collectibles often being hidden by a barrier that can be broken by throwing heavy objects at it. The blowing mechanic from the previous game does not make a return in Tropical Freeze.</p><h3>Kong-Pow</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2582417\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2582417-wiiu_dkctf_gi_scrn_06.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2582417-wiiu_dkctf_gi_scrn_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2582417\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2582417-wiiu_dkctf_gi_scrn_06.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2582417-wiiu_dkctf_gi_scrn_06.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Up top!</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A brand new ability for the partner characters to use with Donkey Kong is the Kong-Pow move. Collecting 100 bananas will fill a gauge next to the heart meter that can then be activated by a button combination. Depending on who Donkey Kong is currently partnering with, the results will change. Executing a Kong-Pow clears the screen of all visible enemies and turns them into items. With Diddy, they turn into 1-Up balloons, with Dixie, they turn into golden hearts that grant one extra hit for each one the player(s) manage to collect (with a maximum of four extra hits possible) and Cranky Kong cause them to turn into banana coins.</p><h3>Features</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2594345-103755_funky_kong_shossipm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2594345\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2594345-103755_funky_kong_shossipm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2594345\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2594345-103755_funky_kong_shossipm.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2594345-103755_funky_kong_shossipm.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Right... \"Surfboard\"...</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/funky-kong/3005-1647\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1647\">Funky Kong</a> also makes his return to the series, but this time, with Cranky now part of the adventuring crew, he will be taking care of the item shop that debuted in the previous game.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tropical Freeze also features online leaderboards that allow sharing of level replays in Time Attack Mode, secret exits to secret levels, Hard Mode and the return of <a href=\"/rambi-the-rhino/3005-11310\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11310\">Rambi the Rhino</a> as the only animal buddy in the game. Notably, the game lacks any Wii U specific features and in fact even turns the GamePad screen off entirely when playing on the TV. Aside from regular Miiverse Community support on a system level, the only special Wii U feature in the game is <a href=\"/off-tv-play/3015-7482\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7482\">Off-TV Play</a>.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Supported controllers are: Wii U GamePad, Wii U Pro Controller, Wii Remote (held sideways), Wii Remote + Nunchuk.</p><h3>Hard Mode</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606280\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606280-irgk3fc67uuzd.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/82063/2606280-irgk3fc67uuzd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2606280\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2606280-irgk3fc67uuzd.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2606280-irgk3fc67uuzd.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Diddy has clear eyes, a full heart but he can most definitely still lose. </figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Similar to Mirror Mode in Donkey Kong Country Returns, Hard Mode in Tropical Freeze limits players to one heart, meaning one-hit deaths, no buddy characters, no support items from Funky's shop and presents blue K.O.N.G. letters to collect. Additionally, Hard Mode lets solo players choose any of the four characters to play any given level with from the world map, in contrast to the normal mode in which player one is automatically assigned Donkey Kong and only the second player can choose between the three support buddies. Hard Mode does not feature mirrored levels like in DKC Returns but instead removes all checkpoints from levels making it significantly harder to reach the end.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Hard Mode is unlocked by finishing all levels in all worlds.

Metroid Prime combines multiple gameplay elements, such as platforming, <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzles</a>, <a href=\"/exploration/3015-767\" data-ref-id=\"3015-767\">exploration</a> and shooting, while presenting a large, <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-ended world</a>.</p><p>Metroid Prime revolves around <a href=\"/phazon/3015-49\" data-ref-id=\"3015-49\">Phazon</a>, a highly radioactive substance with mutagenic properties. The game takes place on <a href=\"/tallon-iv/3035-168\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\">Tallon IV</a>, which has been corrupted by this substance. Throughout her journey, <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus</a> learns more about the nature of Phazon, as well as how her enemies, the <a href=\"/space-pirate/3015-1137\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1137\">Space Pirates</a>, intend to use it. She also learns of the <a href=\"/chozo/3015-605\" data-ref-id=\"3015-605\">Chozo</a>'s struggles, an ancient race that lived on Tallon IV when the infection first arrived.</p><p>As well as maintaining most of the traditional Metroid gameplay features, Metroid Prime introduces a number of innovations to the series. The first person perspective led to the introduction of <a href=\"/auto-aim/3015-145\" data-ref-id=\"3015-145\">lock-on targeting</a>, which allowed for a more intuitive combat system, as well as the ability to strafe around enemies. A <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">heads-up display</a> was introduced, which showed Samus' health bar and ammunition, among other details. A multiple visor system was incorporated, which allowed for different kinds of displays. The most intriguing display was the scan visor, which allowed a multitude of objects and creatures to be surveyed in great detail, as well as activating lifts and revealing <a href=\"/weak-spot/3015-296\" data-ref-id=\"3015-296\">weak points</a>. A hint system was built into the game to aid players.</p><p>Metroid Prime saw great success worldwide, particularly in America. This commercial success led to the development of a Metroid Prime trilogy, as well as other Metroid Prime spinoffs.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>When Metroid Prime was revealed, the most controversial aspect of the game was its first-person perspective. With the game's release, however, reception eventually turned positive, with many generally accepting that the gameplay did not suffer at all from the new perspective.</p><p>Metroid Prime, like its predecessors, places a large emphasis on exploration. <a href=\"/tallon-iv/3035-168\" data-ref-id=\"3035-168\">Tallon IV</a> is an open world, ready for Samus to discover all its secrets, fitting with Metroid tradition. There are only a few instances in the game where the player is given a linear direction, albeit through subtle hints.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492600\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492600\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492600-mp_queen_2.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The Parasite Queen blasts Samus with a beam of energy.</figcaption></figure><p>The player controls Samus using the analog control stick. Unlike other first-person games of the era, Metroid Prime is controlled primarily with a single analog stick, rather then the dual stick format. In order to look around, players must use the R button. The R button allows the players to use the analog stick to look around and observe the environment, as well as aim at opponents. Samus also has the ability to jump using the B button. Platforming is an important element of Metroid Prime, as in previous entries in the series. Metroid Prime has been praised for its excellence in platforming, something few thought executed well in the first-person perspective.</p><p>Combat in Metroid Prime is similar to that of most other first-person shooter games, utilizing a variety of weapons. Samus fires using the A button, and when in the <a href=\"/morph-ball/3055-1049\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">morph ball</a>, Samus uses the A button to drop bombs. To lock on to enemies, Samus uses the L button. By lightly pressing the L button while locked on, Samus can swap out targets. If the player does not wish to lock on, they can look freely using the R button, and aim at opponents through that method. While locked on, the player can press the B button to dash from side to side. Samus must use all of her beam weapons, as well as her missiles, activated with the Y button.</p><p>The C-stick is used to select the weapon which Samus will use. Samus's basic weapon is the power beam, which she begins with. Throughout the course of the game, Samus can obtain the <a href=\"/plasma-beam/3055-1024\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1024\">plasma beam</a>, the <a href=\"/wave-beam/3055-1023\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1023\">wave beam</a>, and the <a href=\"/ice-beam/3055-906\" data-ref-id=\"3055-906\">ice beam</a>. The plasma beam shoots short tang molten energy and can potentially ignite enemies, as well as melt ice. The wave beam fires three oscillating waves of electric energy, and has a limited homing effect. The ice beam is a cold blast of frozen water, and has a slow rate of fire. It can also potentially freeze an enemy in their tracks for a brief amount of time. Each weapon is strong against particular enemies, and all can be combo fires with Samus' missiles for greater effect. Once Samus obtains the charge beam, all weapons can be charged up as well, providing greater firepower.</p><p>In order to access many areas, Samus must use her weapons to destroy obstacles. Many doors are blocked by shields which require certain weapons to activate, and others have blast shields that must be destroyed with the missiles.</p><p>Samus has a variety of <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">visors</a> which will come in handy throughout the game, as well. The standard visor is the combat visor, which is used through regular gameplay. One of the most important visors, which Samus has at the beginning of the game, is the <a href=\"/scan-visor/3055-1040\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1040\">scan visor</a>. The scan visor is used to scan nearly everything in the environment. Scanning proves useful for gathering details about enemies, and discovering the most efficient way of taking them out. Scanning is also one of the main ways that Metroid Prime implements world-building, providing information on the lifeforms in proximity to Samus, as well as translating diary entries and other logs. Another useful visor is the <a href=\"/thermal-visor/3055-1042\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1042\">thermal visor</a>, which helps Samus track objects in the environment based on their heat signature. This visor is quite helpful in dark areas, enabling samus to see lifeforms clearly. Finally, the <a href=\"/x-ray-visor/3055-1041\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1041\">X-ray</a> vison allows Samus to look through walls to find secret passages, and track enemies who use <a href=\"/stealth-camouflage/3055-846\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">optical camouflage</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492601\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-492601\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/492601-mp_orpheon_parasite_specimen.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>A deceased Parasite specimen in Orpheon.</figcaption></figure><p>Like all previous Metroid games, Samus can transform into the morph ball. The morph ball is activated using the X button. Combat is limited, however, in morph ball mode, and Samus can only use the bombs, dropped using the A or Y buttons. The bombs prove most useful for morph ball jumping. A morph ball jump is performed by laying a bomb, then lingering over the bomb, which will shoot Samus into the air. Multiple bombs can be laid to reach higher areas.</p><p>One of the most useful tools in the game is the map. The <a href=\"/world-map/3015-611\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">map</a> is accessed using the Z button, and is a detailed three dimensional depiction of Tallon IV. As exploration is so important in Metroid Prime, consulting the map becomes regular throughout the course of the game.</p><p>As in all Metroid games, items are scattered across the planet. Samus begins with a number of suit upgrades. After an accident on the Frigate, however, Samus begins on Tallon IV with merely her power beam and power suit. As she explores more and more, she can regain her arsenal. Most weapons and visors are hidden throughout the game, and in order to obtain them and move further on in the game, Samus must find out how to reach them. Not all items are essential to the player's progress; however, some will prove very useful. Energy tanks and missile tanks are not required, but are still of great assistance. Some of the more notable items Samus can find are the <a href=\"/varia-suit/3055-1032\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1032\">Varia Suit</a> and <a href=\"/gravity-suit/3055-1033\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1033\">Gravity Suit</a>, as well as the <a href=\"/hi-jump-boots/3055-1448\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1448\">space jump boots</a>, which allow Samus to <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">double jump</a>. Metroid Prime also marked the return of the <a href=\"/grapple-beam/3055-1053\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1053\">Grapple Beam</a> from <a href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\">Super Metroid</a>, which allowed Samus to grapple onto specific points and swing over great distances.</p><h3>Wii Release</h3><p>On October 2, 2008, Nintendo revealed plans to bring various Gamecube games over to the Wii with new controls, including Metroid Prime. The official name of the Wii release is called \"<a href=\"/new-play-control/3025-1197\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1197\">New Play Control</a>! Metroid Prime\". In this rerelease, players control Samus with the Wiimote and Nunchuck, matching the controls of <a href=\"/metroid-prime-3-corruption/3030-4725\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4725\">Metroid Prime 3</a>. Movement is controlled by the analog stick on the Nunchuck. The biggest change to the controls is the aiming, which is now controlled by the Wii's IR pointer. Lock-on is still available and is done via the Z button. Shooting is mapped to the A button (missiles and other weapons on the directional pad) while jumping is controlled by the B button. As in Metroid Prime 3, changing visors is done by pressing the minus button and choosing the visor wanted by pointing on screen. Despite these changes, the Wii rerelease is the same Metroid Prime that was played on the GameCube. The Wii release also has 16:9 Widescreen and 480p support.</p><h2>Regions</h2><h3>Frigate Orpheon</h3><p>A Space Pirate frigate, this vessel was used by the Space Pirate Science Team for <a href=\"/experiments-gone-awry/3015-2046\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2046\">experiments</a>, some more bizarre than others. This is where the <a href=\"/parasite-queen/3005-4286\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4286\">Parasite Queen</a> resides, as well as the place that gave birth to a reborn <a href=\"/ridley/3005-1305\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley</a>. In the beginning of the game, it is still partly functional. Samus eventually returns to the ruins of the Frigate.</p><h3>Tallon Overworld</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208454\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208454\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9336/208454-metroid_prime_4.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>A cavern in the Tallon Overworld.</figcaption></figure><p>The place where Samus first lands, the Overworld is a green place, always raining.

The Wave Buster depletes ten missiles, as well as an additional five per second.</p><h3>Ice Beam</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/894716-metroidprimewii05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-894716\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56281407035176\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/894716-metroidprimewii05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-894716\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14945/894716-metroidprimewii05.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14945/894716-metroidprimewii05.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>A demonstration of the Ice Beam.</figcaption></figure><p>The Ice Beam has the lowest rate of fire, and the shots themselves move slowly as well, making it hard to hit moving enemies. It can also freeze them, allowing Samus to dispatch them with a single missile. Difficult targets require the charge shot in order to freeze them.</p><h4>Ice Spreader</h4><p>Sends out sheet of ice when it hits, freezing those it hits. Quite useful in confusing situations with an overwhelming number of enemies. The Spreader uses ten missiles.</p><h3>Plasma Beam</h3><p>The Plasma Beam, while fast, has a short range. It can set some enemies on fire due to the extreme heat. The charged version of this beam can melt thick ice with cracks.</p><h4>Flamethrower</h4><p>The flamethrower is a short range weapon that leaves behind fire on whatever it makes contact with, damaging things that touch it. It uses up ten Missiles over two seconds.</p><h2>Suit and Ability Upgrades</h2><p>Samus obtains various upgrades throughout the course of her adventure. These take many forms, and harken back to the original Metroid games.</p><h3>Varia Suit</h3><p>The Varia Suit is the first suit upgrade Samus receives, and the one she is most often associated with. This upgrade also provides a reduction in damage, as well as the ability to visit environments with extreme temperatures without being hurt. It is obtained by defeating Flaahgra in the Chozo Ruins.</p><h3>Gravity Suit</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6828/451485-gravity_suit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-451485\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6828/451485-gravity_suit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-451485\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6828/451485-gravity_suit.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6828/451485-gravity_suit.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Samus in her Gravity Suit.</figcaption></figure><p>This suit upgrade allows Samus to move fluidly underwater, as well as increasing underwater visibility and providing additional damage reduction. It also recolours her suit with an indigo accent in place of the orange palette most associated with her. It is acquired in the Gravity Chamber in Phendrana Drifts.</p><h3>Phazon Suit</h3><p>The result of an overload of pure Phazon, the Phazon Suit is shades of black, silver, and crimson. It protects Samus from the effects of blue phazon (though not orange phazon), and provides the most damage reduction of any suit. It also allows her to use the powerful Phazon beam, only available during her final battle. This upgrade is obtained after the battle with the Omega Pirate, in the Phazon Mines.</p><h3>Visors</h3><p>Samus' visor has many different capabilities. The standard types are the combat and scan visors. There are also two others:</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/894719-metroidprimewii08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-894719\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56281407035176\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/894719-metroidprimewii08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-894719\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14945/894719-metroidprimewii08.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14945/894719-metroidprimewii08.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>An example of the Thermal Visor in action.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Thermal Visor </b>- This visor allows Samus to see the heat signatures of everything around her. It is used to find Shadow Pirates in camoflauge and disabled energy conduits.</p><p><b>X-Ray Viso</b>r - This visor is used to see beyond the visible light spectrum. It allows her to see enemies that are invisible to even thermal imaging, and to see through flesh, most notably seen through Samus' arm cannon, instead only showing her bones.</p><h3>Missile Launcher</h3><p>The missile launcher allows Samus to fire missiles. At first, only five missiles are available to be stored onhand, but this is upgradeable by finding one of many missile expansions throughout the world. They are more powerful than a standard beam shot, and can hone in on targets, as well as opening doors and destroying certain materials.</p><h3>Morph Ball</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-273893\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-273893\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/273893-mprime_47.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The Spider Ball in use.</figcaption></figure><p>In morph ball mode, Samus becomes a ball of pure energy, encased in her power suit, and can roll around, allowing access to areas previously out of reach. It is gotten once the Plated Beetle in the Chozo Ruins has been defeated. It has various upgrades:</p><p><b>Bombs</b> - Getting this upgrade allows Samus to drop small bombs while in Morph Ball form. These can destroy certain materials, are effective against many enemies, and can even serve a purpose in some boss fights. They can also be dropped into bomb slots to activate certain things. It is gotten once the Incinerator Drone in the Chozo Ruins has been beaten.</p><p><b>Power Bombs</b> - Able to destroy Bendezium objects and stronger enemies, the Power Bomb is one of Samus' strongest weapons. The number available can be expanded. This upgrade is obtained by defeating the Beta Drone and passing through the maze in the Phazon Mines.</p><p><b>Boost Bal</b>l - This upgrade affords Samus a short burst of speed while in Morph Ball mode. Useful for traversing half-pipes and defeating smaller enemies. Acquired in Phendrana Canyon in Phendrana Drifts.</p><p><b>Spider Ball</b> - This upgrade allows Samus to stick to and roll along the magnetic tracks that wind around Tallon IV. Bombs provide a small jump off the track. This is gotten by defeating Thardus in Phendrana Drifts.</p><h3>Space Jump Boots</h3><p>These boots give Samus the ability to double jump. They are equipped with boosters to give Samus that extra jump she needs. They are found in the Alcove in Tallon Overworld. They are unique to the <i>Prime</i> series.</p><h3>Grapple Beam</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/1017875-metroidprimegrap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017875\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4231/1017875-metroidprimegrap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017875\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/1017875-metroidprimegrap.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4231/1017875-metroidprimegrap.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Samus using the Grapple Beam to swing across a gap.</figcaption></figure><p>Different from other beams in that it can't be used to attack, the Grapple Beam is used to attach to grapple points and cross large distances.

This led Nintendo to clarify that the game is a \"First Person Adventure\" and not a first-person shooter. Once the game was released, however, many critics and former detractors praised the game's level design and incredible graphics. It was stated as being a great reinvention of the Metroid franchise into 3D. Many stated that the gameplay was well done and that the lock-on feature was a welcome addition as it allowed easy strafing. Still, some stated that the controls were difficult and that a traditional first-person control scheme, where the left analog stick controls movement and the right controls direction, should have been included. </p>", "deck": "Take control of Samus Aran in her first 3D adventure as she battles the Space Pirates on Tallon IV while uncovering the mysterious disappearance of its inhabitants.", "aliases": "mp", "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2550128-primeclean.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2550128-primeclean.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2550128-primeclean.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2550128-primeclean.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2550128-primeclean.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2550128-primeclean.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2550128-primeclean.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/metroid-prime/3030-15473/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-15473/", "number_of_user_reviews": 17, "original_release_date": "2002-11-18 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/", "id": 1, "name": "ESRB: T"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/", "id": 25, "name": "CERO: A"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/", "id": 36, "name": "PEGI: 12+"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:21:16", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-23/", "abbreviation": "GCN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/", "id": 23, "name": "GameCube"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/", "abbreviation": "Wii", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/", "id": 36, "name": "Wii"}], "id": 15473, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Metroid Prime"}, "platform": "Wii", "title": "Metroid Prime"}

These puzzle stages are randomized so the blocks are arranged differently each time players attempt at completing the stage. There are four stages in Babel which are unlocked via the player's progress in the story mode on \"Normal\" difficulty or higher and there are single player and two-player options for this mode.

While trying to figure out what to do, Vincent runs into a girl by the name of <a href=\"/catherine/3005-16284\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16284\">Catherine</a>, a stylish twenty-two-year-old. Vincent is plagued by nightmares shortly before he has a one-night-stand with Catherine; nightmares in which he's climbing a never-ending stairway and must reach the top in order to awaken and survive. Some of Vincent's friends also experience the same recurring nightmares.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is largely split into three distinct parts: story, adventure and action. The story part mainly consists of conveying the game's story by anime and in-game event scenes.</p><p>The adventure part generally takes place at the <a href=\"/stray-sheep/3035-3434\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3434\">Stray Sheep</a>, where, as Vincent, players will trade text-messages with Catherine and Katherine as well as other individuals. Players will be able to choose preset sentences as a reply to the messages sent to them and the characters will react differently to different replies and could even send pictures depending on the reply. Vincent will also be asked to capture cell-phone pictures and send them to various people. At the Stray Sheep, Vincent will also be able to talk to his friends, drink alcohol and participate in various mini-games. New customers will visit the bar occasionally and their facial expressions and conversation options will change daily. Players can miss important conversation if they miss the opportunity to talk to a character at a certain moment.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30280/1681023-2132437523_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1681023\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.55288461538462\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30280/1681023-2132437523_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1681023\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30280/1681023-2132437523_full.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Rapunzel Game.</figcaption></figure><p>In the Stray Sheep, players will find a jukebox that allows them to change the background music to other music featured in other parts of the game. The bar also features an arcade game by the name of <i>Rapunzel</i> that resembles Vincent's nightmares. In <i>Rapunzel</i>, players will guide a character up a tower of blocks and push them in order to create a stairway to reach the top, rescuing Rapunzel from the evil witch. <i>Rapunzel</i>, has over 50 stages with the difficulty rising with each one. Other customers of the Stray Sheep play the game too in addition to Vincent and if the player beats their high scores, more conversational options could potentially be unlocked.</p><p>During the action part that consists of Vincent's nightmare segments, Vincent will have to run from ghoulish monsters while avoiding them, avoiding obstacles and dodging other obstructions to get by.

Over time, the floor collapses so players are required to be quick and efficient as they climb the stages. If Vincent falls off the level or gets captured by a monster, it's game over. The level designs during these sections will be an apparent mix of <a href=\"/25d/3015-660\" data-ref-id=\"3015-660\">2.5D</a> and <a href=\"/3d/3015-1430\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D</a>.</p><p>During these action sequences, sheep will sometimes block Vincent's path in order to make themselves survive.

There are three levels of drunkenness that Vincent can reach. In order to get drunk, players will have to go to the Stray Sheep bar and order drinks among four types: beer, cocktails, whiskey and sake.</p><p>As players drink, Vincent gets hot and the liquor icon on the screen will be engulfed in flames. In the real world, this causes him to suffer from drunkenness which makes him to stumble around when trying to leave the bar to go home. Things change however when Vincent enters the dream world. In the <a href=\"/dream/3035-277\" data-ref-id=\"3035-277\">dream world</a>, on the other hand, how drunk Vincent is determines how powerful he is.

The game will be fully voiced and will have multiple endings as well. These endings will each have their own respective animated sequences. Atlus estimates that it'll take players about 20 hours to finish the game during their first playthrough. There will also be difficulty settings but it has not been said if they will alter the story in any way.</p><p><i>Catherine</i> has been through some major changes in relation to its theme as well as its visuals. Originally, Soejima wanted the game to follow a war theme but, following discussions with <a href=\"/katsura-hashino/3040-90683\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90683\">Hashino</a>, they decided to go with a theme revolving adult love.</p><p>Hashino did research for the depiction of the love triangle of Vincent, Catherine and Katherine in the game by asking the Atlus staff who have lived through similar romantic experiences. One of these interviews, incorporated into the first trailer for <i>Catherine</i>, was a woman who instead talked about the fact that she's only seen herself killing other people in her dreams as opposed to herself being killed.</p><p>All of the anime cutscenes within the game will be created by the Japanese animation studio: <a href=\"/capcom-production-studio-4/3010-1497\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1497\">STUDIO4\u00b0C</a> . The studio has spent approximately a year working on that aspect of <i>Catherine</i> and there will be more than the usual 30 minutes worth of anime cutscenes which can be found in the Persona games.</p><p>The game's composer Shoji Meguro has stated that the game's music can be split into four different categories: classical arrangements (one of which can be heard in <i>Catherine</i>'s first trailer as Bach's Little Fugue) for the action segments of the game, original jazz music for the event parts and string music during the anime cutscenes. The other category will be songs with currently unannounced elements.</p><p>Atlus have incorporated manual lip-syncing to the game's animation that differs from both the Japanese version and the English version as most of the game revolves around believable character interaction and drama.</p><p>The engine that the game uses is primarily the <a href=\"/gamebryo-25/3015-2021\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2021\">Gamebryo</a> engine.</p><h3>Origin</h3><p>The game's existence was first hinted at in the <a href=\"/psp/3045-18\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a> game <a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/3030-27861\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27861\"><i>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable</i></a>. In this game, Vincent appears in the bar Club Escapade on certain days, though in the game he never reveals his name and is simply referred to as \"Man Drinking Alone\" in his dialogue boxes. (His name was later discovered by people looking at the game code where the name \"Vincent\" is attached to the character.) In conversing with <a href=\"/minato-arisato/3005-1425\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1425\">Minato Arisato</a>, he reveals hints related to his problems, though also states specifically that they are nothing that Minato needs to worry about.</p><p>It was cleared up in an interview preformed by <i>Shuukan</i> <i>G\u0113mu no Shokutaku</i> that Catherine is not considered part of Atlus' <a href=\"/megami-tensei/3025-525\" data-ref-id=\"3025-525\"><i>Shin Megami Tensei</i></a> franchise, or has any specific ties to the <a href=\"/persona/3025-456\" data-ref-id=\"3025-456\"><i>Persona</i></a> sub-universe outside of \"fake\" Vincent's cameo in <i>Persona 3 Portable</i>.

Vincent and Spike both share a vague physical resemblance.</li><li>Catherine and Katherine's names are both spelled the same in Japanese (\u30ad\u30e3\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3). The two of them romanize out to 'Kyasarin,' leading to some (intentional) confusion in the game.</li><li>In order to show the appeal of <i>Catherine</i> initially, the designers filled the design documents with ''intense visuals''. Of these visuals was a picture featuring <a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/3030-21373\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21373\"><i>Persona 4</i></a>'s <a href=\"/yukiko-amagi/3005-6113\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6113\">Yukiko Amagi</a>. This document was only meant to convey the game's mechanics; Yukiko won't make an appearance in the final game.</li><li>Originally, the two covers for the game were planned to have both characters in nearly naked, identical poses, but the developers feared that Katherine would lose out to the younger, sexier Catherine. Another early cover featured one girl holding a knife and the other a fork (you'll have to take your guess on who was holding which as that part was left ambiguous).</li><li>The in-game television program that the story mode of Catherine is told through, \"Golden Play Theater,\" is a reference to the Japanese program \"Golden Western Theater\" that aired in the '70s and '80s. It mostly showcased American movies. The opening animation to Golden Play Theater is also directly inspired, and nearly identical in style, to Golden Western Theater.</li><li>It was specified in a podcast that the Vincent who appeared in P3P is a Vincent lookalike. That's why he has a mole in P3P and not in Catherine. The Persona series and Catherine have no relation at all.</li><li>There's an easter egg in the bathroom of the \"Stray Sheep\" bar. If you enter the bathroom and look on the wall to the right of the mirror, there's a faded poster that has an image of <a href=\"/teddie/3005-6118\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6118\">Teddie</a> from <a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/3030-21373\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21373\">Persona 4</a> on it. Teddie also appears as a plush toy near the end of the bar when Vincent is seated, and a <a href=\"/gekkoukan-high-school/3035-873\" data-ref-id=\"3035-873\">Gekkoukan High School</a> patch is visible on a poster in the back of the bar.</li><li>If Vincent sits at the bar, you can see a poster that says: \"Do Flirts Dream Of Sheep Man?\" This is a reference to the book, \"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep\", a cyberpunk thriller by Philip K. Dick.</li><li>On the 7th Day in the Stray Sheep Bar; if you watch the TV, after listing the deaths of the day, the reporter will give a weather report. She suggests that you bring an umbrella because it's going to rain for the next few days. This is a reference to <a href=\"/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/3030-21373\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21373\">Persona 4</a>'s \"weather\" game mechanic.</li><li>In the bar, if you go into the bathroom and look into the mirror you will see a flash of the next boss in the reflection.</li><li>While in the bar, after you order either beer, whiskey, sake or a cocktail you will receive trivia about the type of drink, ordering the same drink or drinks every time you are in the bar will award you with an achievement (a possible four).</li></ul><p> </p>", "deck": "The first game developed by Atlus for the PS3/Xbox 360.

A number of screenshots were shown, featuring Mario in a <a href=\"/raccoon-suit/3055-1246\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1246\">Raccoon Suit</a> (including <a href=\"/p-wing/3055-4364\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4364\">P-Wing</a> meter!) along with a Golden Mario and golden enemies. The game will be released worldwide in both physical retail form and as a digital download via the <a href=\"/3dsware/3045-138\" data-ref-id=\"3045-138\">eShop</a>, making it the first Nintendo-published game to be released in such a manner.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>New Super Mario Bros. 2, like previous entries in the <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros/3025-1546\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1546\">New Super Mario Bros.</a> series, is a side-scrolling platformer built in the vein of the earlier <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3025-1899\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1899\">Super Mario Bros.</a> titles on the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>. This entry, however, puts a greater emphasis on coin collection. A new fire flower-like power-up grants Mario the power to turn enemies and blocks that are in his path into coins.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>During its 3DS showcase at <a href=\"/e3-2012/3015-7024\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7024\">E3 2012</a>, Nintendo revealed that New Super Mario Bros. 2 would feature local <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">2-Player co-op</a> with <a href=\"/mario/3005-177\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> and <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> throughout the full game, as opposed to the original <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros/3030-8224\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8224\">New Super Mario Bros.</a> that had a dedicated Battle Mode for multiplayer. Both players have to stay on the screen at all times. If one of them fails to do so, they fly behind the other player in a bubble as if they had died and the other has to pop them out of it. The camera orientation in the cooperative mode begins centered on the player who is hosting the session, however each player can then fight for control of the orientation by ground-pounding the other.</p><h2>StreetPass Functionality</h2><p>The game's use of <a href=\"/streetpass-functionality/3015-6609\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6609\">StreetPass</a> encompasses a competitive mode reminiscent of EA's <a href=\"/autolog/3015-7018\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7018\">autolog/battlelog</a>. Since this game is all about gold coins, there are special challenges that make players run through three levels in a row with only one life with the goal to collect the most gold coins possible.

The player races through several courses in the <a href=\"/grand-prix/3015-3962\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3962\">Grand Prix</a>, winning new characters, karts, courses, and modes. The game also has a <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">cooperative mode</a>, in which one player controls each character in the <a href=\"/go-kart/3055-552\" data-ref-id=\"3055-552\">kart</a>. Up to two players or four players using co-op mode may compete in Grand Prix mode. One player steers the kart while the rear player holds an item and can throw it to the player up front at any time which also allows to hold up to two items. For the first time in the series, a kart can now activate the all new starting boost technique, the Double Dash!! This super boost can be achieved if <a href=\"/lakitus-start-signal/3055-1987\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1987\">Lakitu's Start Signal</a> turns green and both members activate the <a href=\"/rocket-start/3015-1823\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1823\">rocket start</a> at the same time. 3, 2, 1... <a href=\"/double-dash/3015-3017\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3017\">DOUBLE DASH!!</a></p><h2>Versus</h2><p>Players can compete without computer players in Versus mode.

They are all shocked to see themselves gathered in one area, friend and foe alike. Before they have a chance to start attacking each other, a giant screen lights up in front of them, an alien by the name of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4075\" href=\"/nitros-oxide/3005-4075\">Nitros Oxide</a> declares that he wants to race the best driver in this world and that if he, Nitros Oxide, wins he will turn the world into a giant parking lot. He says that he doesn't know who the best racer in the land is so he wants everyone to race against each other and he will challenge the winner. Once the player collects of all the Time Relics, CTR Tokens and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-445\" href=\"/crystal/3055-445\">Crystals</a>, Oxide admits defeat and returns to his home planet.</p><h2>Adventure</h2><p>Adventure mode is the single player story mode of the game. At the beginning you choose one character from the roster and find yourself in an open world environment. From here the player can access races through <a data-ref-id=\"3015-804\" href=\"/warp-zone/3015-804\">warp zones</a> similar to those seen in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12909\" href=\"/crash-bandicoot-warped/3030-12909\">Crash Bandicoot 3</a>. After the player has finished first they can either go and play unlocked levels or complete Time Trial races or CTR races. Time Trial has the player attempt 3 <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1202\" href=\"/laps/3015-1202\">laps</a> round the track in a short specific time, the only way to achieve these is to master the quickest paths and smash time crates which stop the counter. In CTR races the player has to collect CTR tokens scattered around the level whilst still coming first place. Finally the other way to get CTR tokens in through challenges in adventure, the player must speed around the battle levels and collect crystals under a certain time limit. Completing races continues the plot of the game and unlocks more races and enviroments. After a set amount of races have been completed Boss Races become availiable from famous <a data-ref-id=\"3015-229\" href=\"/bosses/3015-229\">bosses</a> in the Crash franchise. Once beaten the Bosses open new enviroments for the player with new warp zones and challenges. While the player does not need to complete Time Trials and CTR token races they are used to unlock additional characters later in the game.</p><h3>Bosses</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/367018-ctr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367018\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 350px\" data-ratio=\"0.74857142857143\" data-width=\"350\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5052/367018-ctr1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367018\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5052/367018-ctr1.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The game in action</figcaption></figure><p>The following are the boss racers you will encounter in the Adventure Mode;</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-12156\" href=\"/ripper-roo/3005-12156\">Ripper Roo</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-11696\" href=\"/papu-papu/3005-11696\">Papu Papu</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-14668\" href=\"/komodo-joe/3005-14668\">Komodo Joe</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-3980\" href=\"/pinstripe/3005-3980\">Pinstripe</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-4075\" href=\"/nitros-oxide/3005-4075\">Nitrous Oxide</a></li></ul><h3>Areas</h3><p>The game is spilt up into different five different areas where races are unlocked and played:</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>N.Sanity Beach</b></li></ul><p>Crash Cove, Roo's Tubes, Mystery Caves and Sewer Speedway.</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>The Lost Ruins</b></li></ul><p>Coco Park, Tiger Temple, Papu's Pyramid and Dingo Canyon.</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Glacier Park</b></li></ul><p>Blizzard Bluff, Dragon Mines, Polar Pass and Tiny Arena.</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>The Citadel</b></li></ul><p>N.

You will get an increase in your top speed and it will modify any power ups that you get to make them stronger e.g. A <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1166\" href=\"/tnt-crate/3055-1166\">TNT crate</a> will become a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1167\" href=\"/nitro-crate/3055-1167\">Nitro crate</a>. You can collect wumpa fruit by smashing spring box crates and you can also pick up loose wumpa fruit scattered around the track. If you have wumpa fruit and you are hit by an enemy racer or if you fall off the track the number of wumpa fruit you have will decrease.</p><p><b>Uka Uka/Aku Aku</b> - The Voodoo mask provides 3 different effects to the player for a limited time. A mask will spin around the player and they will recieve a noticable increase in speed, invunerability to other racer's power ups and the player can also hit other racers to cause them to spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the power up lasts longer. Good characters will receive the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1235\" href=\"/aku-aku/3005-1235\">Aku Aku</a> mask and bad characters will get the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1377\" href=\"/uka-uka/3005-1377\">Uka Uka</a> mask, there is no gameplay difference between the masks.</p><p><b>Green and Red Bottles</b> - Green bottles can be dropped behind the player or can be fired foward. If a racer hits a green bottle they will spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit a red bottle is obtained instead. The red bottle has a similar effect to the green bottle but it also forms a raincloud over the player that hits it. The player is slowed down and also loses the ability to hop. Red and green bottles can also be used to deflect incoming attacks.</p><p><b>Homing Missiles</b> - <a data-ref-id=\"3055-857\" href=\"/homing-missile/3055-857\">Homing missiles</a> will lock on to the nearest racer in front of you when fired. They will follow racers until they hit their target but can be avoided by obstucting their path with track terrain or using a TNT/Nitro crate to destroy them. When upgraded by wumpa fruit they cause racers to spin out for longer. A triple version of this power up is also available where the racer gets 3 <a data-ref-id=\"3055-713\" href=\"/rocket/3055-713\">rockets</a> instead of 1 from a single pick up.</p><p><b>TNT and Nitro Crates</b> - A TNT crate can be dropped behind you to obstruct other racers. If a racer hits a TNT crate it will land on their head and countdown. The racer has 3 seconds to shake the TNT off before it explodes by hopping up and down. If caught in the TNT blast radius racers will spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit a TNT crate becomes a Nitro crate. Nitro crates have the same effect except they lack the delay and explode on contact. TNT/Nitro crates can be used to block incoming attacks.</p><p><b>Bowling Balls</b> - <a data-ref-id=\"3055-746\" href=\"/bowling-ball/3055-746\">Bowling balls</a> can be fired fowards or backwards. They travel in a straight line and explode on contact with either racers or terrain. They cause racers to spin out when hit and they can also be detonated by pressing circle again after they have been released. When upgraded by wumpa fruit they cause the racer to spin out for longer. A triple power up is also available where the racer gets 3 bowling balls instead of 1.</p><p><b>Warp Orb</b> - Once it has been fired, a warp orb will travel the course ahead of you and make anyone in the vicinity spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit, it lasts longer.</p><p><b>Green and Blue Shields -</b> Green shields when activated will protect you from a single attack or will eventually fade away if you are not hit. You can also fire the shield ahead of you like a bowling ball. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the shield turns blue and will protect you from more damage.</p><p><b>Timer</b> - When activated it will slow down all other racers to crawling speed for a short time. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the power up lasts longer.</p><p><b>Turbo</b> - A <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1209\" href=\"/turbo/3055-1209\">turbo</a> will give you a prolonged burst of speed like the boost gained from power sliding. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the boost lasts for longer.</p><h2>Turbo</h2><p>As well as the turbo gained from the power up turbo, boost can also be gained from a few different techniques:</p><p><b>Turbo Start -</b> At the begining of each race it is possible to gain a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-461\" href=\"/boost/3015-461\">boost</a> right from the go by timing your acceleration with the lights. If you time your acceleration to the half-way point between the last red light and the green you will get an instant boost.</p><p><b>Power-sliding Turbos</b> - Pressing and holding the R1 button around a corner will make you perform a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16728\" href=\"/powerslide/3030-16728\">powerslide</a>. When the smoke from the exhaust turns black you can give yourself a small turbo by pressing the L1 button. You can do 3 boosts in one powerslide at a time. This technique is essential to getting the best times on tracks.</p><p><b>Jump Turbos</b> - Jump turbos are performed by hopping off the top of a ramp, hump or ridge and then landing. Once you land the boost kicks in. The longer you are in the air the more boost you get when you land. Jumping and landing on flat ground is not enough to inact the jump boost.</p><h2>Spyro 2 Demo</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219310\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 238px\" data-ratio=\"1.0840336134454\" data-width=\"238\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219310\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6559/219310-spyro_the_dragon.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Eager players got an early look at Spyro 2</figcaption></figure><p>On the main menu screen, if the player types in the cheat code, \"Hold L1 R1 and press Down, Circle, Triangle, Triangle, Right\" they will unlock a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1563\" href=\"/spyro-2-riptos-rage/3030-1563\">Spyro the Dragon 2: Gateway to Glimmer</a> demo.

It was developed by Nintendo's in-house development studio, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3433\" href=\"/nintendo-software-technology-corporation/3010-3433\">NST</a>. The gameplay is mostly racing oriented, and unlike <a data-ref-id=\"3025-564\" href=\"/ssx/3025-564\">SSX</a> focuses very little on tricks. Even when tricks are possible to do in the game, the player is not rewarded for doing them, and therefore the player is discouraged to do them. The tricks in the game are very similar to SSX, but the user controls them with the bumpers, and not button combination. The game also features 2 player play. In addition, the game was one of the only games that the Gamecube ever supported to go online.</p><h2>Long Development</h2><p>The game suffered from a long development time, being firstly announced in 1998, and was originally announced to the Nintendo 64 platform. When the original developer left field failed to finalize the game, the work shifted on to NST. Most fans presumed that NST completely rewrote the game because it was nothing like the original. Later NST released information that the game, while being in different direction from the original 1080 snowboarding game, was indeed based on the original version.</p>", "deck": "The sequel to the game 1080 Snowboarding for the Nintendo 64.", "aliases": "1080\u00b0 Silverstorm\n1080: Silver Storm", "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2213144-box_1080a.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/1080-avalanche/3030-19339/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-19339/", "number_of_user_reviews": 1, "original_release_date": "2003-11-28 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/", "id": 7, "name": "PEGI: 3+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/", "id": 19, "name": "CERO: All Ages"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:46:34", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-23/", "abbreviation": "GCN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23/", "id": 23, "name": "GameCube"}], "id": 19339, "resource_type": "game", "name": "1080\u00b0 Avalanche"}, "platform": "Gamecube", "title": "1080 Avalanche"}

Like in the books, there is always a contest going on between the houses in points, which are gained by doing things well in the classes.

This broom can be obtained at any time while outside, though not in missions where the player has to go to the Forbidden Forest. This can actually be used to make certain missions easier, for instance; in one mission, school prefects must be avoided while trying to get across the school grounds in order to get to <a href=\"/rubeus-hagrid/3005-11628\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11628\">Hagrid's</a> house. The broom can be used to fly across the school grounds, avoiding that part of the mission entirely. The broomstick can also be used to reach otherwise inaccessible part of the castle, like certain rooftops.</li></ul><ul><li>There are huge differences between the PlayStation and PlayStation 2/Xbox versions of the game. For instance, while Harry travels to Diagon Alley with flu powder, things go wrong. On PlayStation, the player must attempt to keep Harry on the middle of the slide with the analog stick. On PlayStation 2 however, this sequence is not present at all, and the player simply gets dropped off in a cutscene. This is one of the few examples of the PlayStation game having more content in a gameplay sequence.

The subtitle roughly translates as \"Slick's Great Challenge\") is an action platformer game based on the Incredible Crash Dummies license, a toy series that became an animated TV show. The player controls Slick, one of the titular Incredible Crash Dummies, and must rescue Dr Zub from the evil Junkman before he can use the good Doctor's knowledge to create an army of robots.</p><p>The game was released on many home systems of the era, some of which varied slightly in their presentation and gameplay. </p><h2>Game Boy Version</h2><p>The Game Boy version of The Incredible Crash Dummies featured many different forms of gameplay, resembling more of a mini-game collection than its Super Nintendo counterpart. Players must either successfully crash the playable dummy, or successfully pass the Dummy through various levels.</p><h3>Levels (Dummy Stunts)</h3><p>Five separate stunts await the Dummy for testing. The <strong>Roof Jump</strong> comprises of a vertical drop off the edge of a burning building. Players receive more points for each awning they are able to break, and for each fire hazard they are able to avoid. A target is painted on the sidewalk, which the Dummy must hit in order to progress to the next stage of testing.</p><p>The <strong>Air Bumper</strong> stage puts the Dummy behind the wheel of a new car model, with improved air bumper safety features. The player must steer the car over air cans in order to inflate the bumper, while avoiding large pits on the test track, along with oil slicks that cause the Dummy's vehicle to spin out.</p><p>The <strong>Ski Slope</strong> tests the Dummy's agility and reflexes, as trees must be avoided, and points are awarded for any jumps completed.</p><p>The Dummy proceeds to enter the <strong>Bomb Factory</strong>, where the player must ensure the quality of bombs created by blowing out any lit fuses. Failing to do so on any three bombs will result in the stunt starting over. Conveyor belts move the bombs from the top of the screen to the bottom, with other various items. The Dummy is instructed to smash all of the other items with a mallet, ensuring that only quality tested bombs make it through the factory.</p><p>The <strong>Cruise Missle</strong> stunt is an arcade style level, where the player navigates a space ship in an extremely low gravity environment. Changing the ship's trajectory requires rotating the vehicle and igniting the engine, creating a delicate balance between speed and maneuverability as the player is timed. The Dummy must crash the ship on yet another bulls eye, ending the stunt.</p><p>After the end of each stunt, the Dummy's boss will critique the player's work. The Dummy receives cash if the stunt went as planned, and a small bonus if the boss was impressed. Three levels of difficulty are presented, with easy, normal, and hard, encouraging the player to revisit each stunt for more cash.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p>Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a review score of 4 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, \"...This side-scrolling, survive the levels-type game is cute at times, but the poor control and mandatory cheap hits by enemies ruin things\".</p>", "deck": "The Incredible Crash Dummies capitalizes on the early '90s popularity of the Crash Dummy characters.

Mikey must search the Fratellis' expansive, labyrinth-like lair to find his friends and bring peace back to the town of Goon Docks.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5018/398543-goonies.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398543\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.3575\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:35.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5018/398543-goonies.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398543\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5018/398543-goonies.gif\"/></a><figcaption>Mikey, The Goonies, and Annie The Mermaid</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the world is a sidescrolling platformer with pits to navigate and enemies to avoid or destory. Ladders, vines, and moving platforms allow for increased access to the various levels. When the player goes from place to place using a door, the game changes into the \"First Person\" style of play. The player can then select from several different ways of interacting with the environment, like \"Go\", \"Hit\", or \"Take\". Most of the rooms are empty; some have exit doors, or picture frames, safes, and sometimes other random characters. The player is also able to use an assortment of \"Tools\". The main rooms that Mikey needs to find are the ones that have his other friends, \"The Goonies\", held captive. Each \"Goonie\" that Mikey releases gives him an extra bar of health.</p><h2>Items</h2><p>Mikey has several different choices of weapons to use during the game. Starting off, he only has his trusty Yo-Yo. Mikey can also find others like the slingshot, boomerang, Molotov cocktails, and bombs. Mikey also can pick up other useful items that help him in his quest to save his friends:</p><ul><li>The hammer allows Mikey to reveal hidden doors, safes, and holes in the floor and ceiling.</li><li>The ladder can be used to climb through holes in the ceiling or floor.</li><li>The candle can be used to illuminate darkened rooms.</li><li>Keys will open prison cells and safes.</li><li>A helmet can protect Mikey from falling icicles and stalagmites.</li><li>Glasses reveal secret areas.</li><li>Two different types of shoes: one allows Mike to move faster, the other allows him to jump really high.</li><li>There is a raincoat to protect Mikey from waterfalls and geysers.</li><li>Scuba gear to give Mikey access to underwater areas.</li><li>A bulletproof vest will decrease the damage taken from projectiles, such as those fired by the Fratellis.</li><li>The radio, necessary for receiving special messages.</li><li>Transceiver boxes which are instrumental in locating the imprisoned Goonies.</li></ul><h2>Enemies</h2><p>Other than the normal throwaway enemies in the game (like ghostly armor, or dragons, killer eskimo kids, snakes, spiders and strange tigers), the Fratellis are the main bad guys (and girl). However, they cannot be beaten (with the exception of Pip-Squeak); they are simply dazed long enough that Mikey can get by them.</p><ul><li>Jake Fratelli - Large guy in blue suit. Attacks Mikey with a gun.</li><li>Francis Fratelli - Skinny version of Jake. Arrows being his weapon of choice.</li><li>Mama Fratelli - Old lady from the movie. Throws bombs that bounce along after Mikey.</li><li>Cousin \"Pip-Squeak\" Fratelli (Not actually in the movie at all) - Short, squatty guy. Jumps at Mikey.

Reminds the player \"It's fun to play the Goonies 2.\" Also will drop the candle if Mikey punches her 5 times.</li><li>Konami Man - Superman or Captain America fan apparently, wears a red and blue suit. Refills Mikey's health bar if the player finds his room, which is usually quite difficult.</li><li>Eskimo - He is an Eskimo. (\"I am ERROR\")</li><li>Fish Man - He's a man, no a fish. He will sometimes give out bonuses including the high jump shoes.</li><li>Goonies - They are Mikey's friends and are being held in locked prison cells.</li><li>Ambassador Konami - A yellow alien looking dude that says \"Rescue all 6 Goonies to help Annie.\"</li><li>Annie the Mermaid - Just like the other Goonies, she is being held captive by the Fratellis at the end of the second underwater zone.

The instruction booklet states that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1239\" href=\"/tanzra/3005-1239\" slug=\"tanzra\">Tanzra</a> and his six guardians attacked the Master. The Master was injured after the long battle, so he retreated to his sky palace and proceeded to fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>While the Master was sleeping, Tanzra drove the world into ruins. He divided the world into six lands with each being ruled by one of the guardians. When the Master awakes, fully rejuvenated, he is ready to free the world from the oppression of Tanzra.</p><p>After defeating Tanzra, civilizations begin to stop worshiping the Master with many losing faith in him and turning to other things. The servant notes this, and says that people only appear to pray and trust to the Master in times of trouble.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In ActRaiser, the player takes control of an incredibly powerful being known only as the Master. The Master has been awakened from a deep sleep to find the world in ruin. He and his loyal servant (a small angelic creature) then set out to rebuild civilization.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/389799-actraiser_58.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389799\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/389799-actraiser_58.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389799\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2014/389799-actraiser_58.png\"/></a><figcaption>The Master takes the form of a warrior; here he is battling a boss</figcaption></figure><p>To begin this rebuilding process, the Master positions his sky palace above an area filled with enemies and demons. Then, the Master takes on the form of a strong warrior wielding a large sword. In these side-scrolling areas, the warrior uses his sword to dispatch many hazards, such as environmental hazards or monsters. The warrior can pick up power-ups by destroying statues situated in certain places around the level. The power-ups have a variety of effects, from healing the warrior, to bonus points. After defeating the boss of the level, the warrior moves onto the next section of the city-building portion.</p><p>The life bar that the Master has in his warrior form can also be extended as the Master gains levels. Leveling up is done through an experience system, in which the combined population of the Master's rebuilt towns amasses into experience. Also gained in leveling up is more SP, which can then be used to preform miraculous events in the city-building part of the game. Magical spells can also be granted to the Master through his followers that he can use in his warrior form. These spells deal significantly more damage than regular attacks, making them essential to the completion of the game.</p><p>In the city-building portion of the game, the player takes control of the Master's servant, a small cupid-like creature. Each town begins with only two humans, who then follow the Master's commands and aid him in rebuilding his world. They must be guided (the direction they are guided in is where they will build), and in turn will build houses, roads, and farms. The villagers eventually gain use of other skills, such as composing music or creating bridges.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-464816\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-464816\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6150/464816-oversee.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Building a city</figcaption></figure><p>The Master also has the use of several magical powers in the city-building portion. He can summon lightning, rain, sun, wind, or earthquakes. Using these abilities, trees, rocks, snow, monsters, and much more can be cleared. In a few sections of the game, the abilities must be used to assist the villagers, starting windmills or putting out fires, for example.</p><p>However, the city-building isn't calm. There are several Monster Lairs scattered around the map. Monsters are spawned out of these lairs. The people have the ability to seal these lairs, making it a necessity to guide the population to the lairs. The cupid can attack the monsters using his arrows, but once he loses all of his life, he cannot attack until the people increase in population. Once all of the Monster Lairs are sealed, the people can gain even more advanced technology and techniques.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712890\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712890\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3661/1712890-cover_l.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Symphonic Suite from ActRasier</figcaption></figure><p>The critically acclaimed 16-bit soundtrack was composed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-5461\" href=\"/yuzo-koshiro/3040-5461\" slug=\"yuzo-koshiro\">Yuzo Koshiro</a>.

The US/EU version of Rocket Knight Adventures 2 is known as just Sparkster, making it easy to confuse with this SNES spin-off.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Sparkster controls like a typical 2D platformer. Many areas feature thin ledges that can be grabbed by Sparkster's prehensile tail and climbed around on. A regular attack with the sword also launches a projectile across the screen, and holding down the button after attacking will charge the rocket pack, which takes about a second. Once charged, holding a direction and releasing the button will send Sparkster shooting away. While dashing with the rocket pack Sparkster will ricochet wildly off walls, floors and ceilings, which is sometimes the only way to reach a certain area. Sparkster can also use a flip move by pressing the R and L buttons, which will cause Sparkster to quickly flip right or left. This can be done in mid air and is a great way to get around, but using it too many times in a row makes Sparkster dizzy and unable to move for a while.</p><p>In addition, Sparkster has a few unique levels that switch up the gameplay. There's a level where Sparkster pilots giant mechanical ostriches, which run automatically. He can fire ripple laser shots from the bird's mouth and make it go up and down to grab crystals as it speeds by. Towards the end of the game, there is a section where the player controls the game as a top-down shooter. That level's boss fight involves piloting a fighting mech, which is controlled by pressing the R and L buttons to punch with the respective hand.</p>", "deck": "Sort of a spin-off game to the Genesis game known as Rocket Knight Adventures.

The game is a sidescrolling platformer, using ninja weapons to attack all foes and even acrobatic skills to reach areas of the game. Because of this, the game feel familiar to the original <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3025-472\" data-ref-id=\"3025-472\">Ninja Gaiden</a> or <a href=\"/strider/3025-321\" data-ref-id=\"3025-321\">Strider</a> games. The character designs are the work of Keita Amemiya who also worked on the Japan-only <a href=\"/rudra-no-hihou/3030-564\" data-ref-id=\"3030-564\">Rudra no Hihou</a> as well as the <a href=\"/onimusha/3025-467\" data-ref-id=\"3025-467\">Onimusha</a> series.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>There were two clans who learned ninjutsu and black magic known as the Fuma and Koma clans. It was the job of the Fuma clan to protect a Holy Grail, whereas the Koma Clan wanted to use this Grail for ultimate power and conquer the world. They attacked the Fuma Clan and stole the Holy Grail from their hands. All members were killed except for one person, Hagane. He was then revived by Momochi by transforming him into an advanced android where his body was all robotics and his mind was still human. He then pursued forward into destroying the Koma clan and claiming back the power before it is used to conquer the world.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The games play similar to the old Ninja Gaiden games where the player can move left and right, can jump on platforms and kill enemies with his sword as well has a vast range of weapons in his disposal.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><h4><b>Sword</b></h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2304530-2304529-hagane__e__00000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2304530\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.38235294117647\" data-width=\"68\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 68px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:38.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2304530-2304529-hagane__e__00000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2304530\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/137417/2304530-2304529-hagane__e__00000.png\"/></a></figure><p>A good all round weapon.

Very useful for the difficult stages.</p><h3>Techniques and Combat</h3><p>Few things that Hagane has to offer is his agility in movement and also in combat. He can pull off many types of jumps and his attacks in combination with his movement can produce different abilities.</p><ul><li><b>Jump</b> - Player jumps in the air.</li><li><b>Mid-Air Roll -</b> Does this by rolling forward in mid air. Must time the jump perfectly to perform action.</li><li><b>Slide</b> - Can slide on the ground for a short amount of distance.</li><li><b>Foot Stomp</b> - Whilst in the air, he can bounce on enemies with his foot causing extra damage.</li><li><b>Latch -</b> He can latch onto ceilings or platforms above him to grab onto. Very useful for the later levels.</li><li><b>Wall Jump</b> - Whilst doing the Mid-Air Roll near a wall, he can wall jump and if there are 2 narrow walls, he can also wall climb to the top. However if there isn't a wall, he will slowly float back down.</li></ul><h4><b>Somersault Attacks</b></h4><p>Not only is the somersault good for evading attacks, but can also be used to attack. These types of attacks are used with the somersault buttons and pressing the attack button. Upon holding either of the shoulder buttons, with the character facing in the appropriate direction, the character produces 3 types of somersaults, with the distance shortening each time. Pressing either the attack or jump button will result in a new technique.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Number of Somersaults</th><th>After pressing Attack</th><th>After pressing Jump</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 - Normal somersault</td><td>Dashing Forward Punch</td><td>Flying Kick</td></tr><tr><td>2 - Partially charged with green aura</td><td>Spin Kick</td><td>Spinning Dragon Flame</td></tr><tr><td>3 - Fully charged with yellow aura</td><td>Ground Dragon Smash</td><td>Vertical Upwards Kick</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Items</h2><ul><li>Kunai Blades - Adds 10 additional blades to stock.</li><li>Extra Bombs - Adds 10 bombs to stock.</li><li>Health - Heals one bar of health.</li><li>Extra Health - Add one additional health bar to life. Maximum amount of bars can be stacked to 5 bars.</li></ul><p>The levels themselves do have a strict learning curve due to the perfect timings on platforms as well as distinct boss patterns that they have.</p><h2>Bosses</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2371628-hagane__e__00003.png\"

There is the occasional branching path as well, which allows the player try a different stage if they're having trouble with the current one. As well as jumping and attacking, Sky can also climb walls and leap off them as well as use several offensive and defensive spells, many of which also increase his ability to traverse a stage as well. Some aerial stages require that Sky take to the air with his wings, a few of which use the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 functionality - these stages play a lot more like a shoot 'em up.</p><p>Sky has several methods of attack which he gains by finding them spread around the levels. Sky's basic attack, a punch and kick combo, costs no magic points and he can perform it as often as he likes. He can also use the Dragon Slash from the offset, which is a powerful finishing attack that uses a little magic.</p><p>Additionally, by defeating certain bosses/stages he can acquire:</p><ul><li>The Comet Flash, which sends Sky flying horizontally. This is invaluable for passing by floor obstacles like spikes and lava.</li><li>Lightning Strike, which clears the screen of enemies. It's a move best left for emergencies, when enemies threaten to overcome the hero.</li><li>Star Fire, which fires bullets in eight directions away from Sky.</li><li>Heal, which gives Sky some health back.</li><li>Warrior Force, a helpful buff that turns Sky invincible and increases his attack power.</li><li>Time Stop, a power that freezes all enemies.

The game commemorates the 10th anniversary of the series and is the last titled game in the franchise for 11 years (before <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-9/3030-20975\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20975\">Mega Man 9</a>).</p><p>Set in the year <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/year-x/3015-7424\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7424\">20XX</a>, the game takes place shortly after the events of Mega Man 7 (in which the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/android/3015-692\" data-ref-id=\"3015-692\">humanoid robot</a> hero <a href=\"/mega-man/3005-344\" data-ref-id=\"3005-344\">Mega Man</a> defeats both the evil roboticist <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/dr-wily/3005-291\" data-ref-id=\"3005-291\">Dr. Wily</a>, for the seventh time, and new-found rival <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/bass/3005-1594\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1594\">Bass</a>). Two mysterious forces battle in outer space before crash-landing down to Earth, causing Mega Man (who was battling Bass at the time) to investigate.

An unofficial 8-bit <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/demake/3015-7736\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7736\">\"demake\"</a> of Mega Man 8 was finished in 2010, coinciding with the release of the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/deliberately-retro/3015-996\" data-ref-id=\"3015-996\">deliberately-retro</a> <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-10/3030-29413\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29413\">Mega Man 10</a>.

Not wanting to make a half-hearted attempt, they ended up making an original Mega Man game (exclusively for Japan in its original run) using most of the assets from Mega Man 8 (including two of the game's bosses, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tengu-man/3005-1549\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1549\">Tengu Man</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/astro-man/3005-1440\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1440\">Astro Man</a>), titled <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-bass/3030-13218\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13218\">Rockman &amp; Forte</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay is similar to the previous games, but with some additions. The main priority is the player picks a level and fights the end boss; Mega Man will earn a weapon for defeating the boss. Rush also returns with some special abilities. Also returning from <a href=\"/mega-man-7/3030-7391\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7391\">Mega Man 7</a> is the item store.</p><p>Like <i>Mega Man 7</i>, only four robot masters are available at the start. After the player beats the first four, the other four will appear. The weapons earned from the first four robot masters play a big role in the other four levels; for example, in <a href=\"/search-man/3005-10196\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10196\">Search Man</a>'s stage, the thunder claw that was earned from <a href=\"/clown-man/3005-1609\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1609\">Clown Man</a>, is used to get through spiked gaps by using the thunder claw to grab on to metal poles and swing to the other side.</p><p>Rush returns in <i>Mega Man 8</i>, this time with new abilities. Old abilities like Rush Marine and Rush Coil have been retired, but new abilities are introduced. Each new ability can be earned by defeating the mid bosses in some of the game's levels. The first new ability is Rush can transform into a motorcycle - Mega Man can hop on, shoot projectiles, and run at high speed. The other is Rush will drop a random item for Mega Man, which can be a health item or ammunition for Mega Man's weapon. Rush can also fly up in the air and drop health or ammunition items for Mega Man. The last new ability is Rush can fly up in the air and aid Mega Man in battle by dropping missiles on enemies.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1116076-untitled.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1116076\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.74423480083857\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29889/1116076-untitled.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1116076\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29889/1116076-untitled.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The item store.</figcaption></figure><p>Also returning from <i>Mega Man 7</i> is the item store.

Together with angel \"Ekoro\" and robot \"Beck\" he fights to free successivefuly occupied major city facilities.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, those typos are in the game too.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>Each of the three playable characters plays in a similar manner, with some unique abilities given to each. While all three can do the standard jumping and shooting, reminiscent of the 8-bit Mega Man games, only Gunvolt can do a double jump mid-air, Ekoro can briefly hover with her wings, and Beck is the only one able to slide dash under low objects. All levels have short alternative paths that only some of the characters will be able to reach thanks to their differing moves.</p><p>Each character also has a different charge-up attack. Gunvolt unleashes a powerful electric chain that he can move up and down in front of him, however he is unable to move while doing this. Beck can store a charge while moving that allows him to dash a short distance forward (different to his slide dash) that also damages enemies and can even be done mid-air. When Ekoro charges up her gun and fires it, a large heart shoots out that will \"mark\" an enemy. Now when she kills this enemy, instead of exploding, a halo appears over its head. The enemy is now an ally which will float behind her, shooting other enemies on screen until it takes enough damage to be destroyed once and for all.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>Mighty Gunvolt has 5 levels: School, Train, Lab, Tower, and Mirror. Depending on which character the player selects to play the game, the levels appear in a different order. Specifically, Ekoro starts in the school, which is an 8-bit recreation of a level from Gal Gun complete with giant tentacled plant monster. Beck and Gunvolt both start on the Train level.</p><p>Several stats are collected about each level, which can be viewed when selecteing a save file. The game tracks Hi Score, Fastest Time, Max Combo, and Clear Rate for each level, making score and time attacks a good reason to replay levels.</p><p> </p>", "deck": "A crossover game between Mighty No. 9, Azure Striker Gunvolt and Gal Gun.

{"duration": "0:51:00", "runner": "Hornlitz", "data": {"expected_release_year": null, "date_last_updated": "2014-11-24 14:53:19", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Ape Escape is an action/adventure game developed by <a href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\">Sony Computer Entertainment America</a>. The object of the game is to battle and capture monkeys that have gone rampant. It is also the first game to require the Dualshock controller, for it needed the use of both thumb sticks.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>The whole point of the game is to stop Specter and his evil monkeys. Your mission is to stun the monkeys with any combination of your items, and then capture them with the gadget known as the Time Net. This net captures the monkeys and sends them back to the present. More Gadgets would be given to you as you progress through the game. The available Gadgets are:</p><ul><li><b>Time Net -</b> The only Gadget that can capture monkeys (on land). Swing the right analog stick to swing the net.</li><li><b>Stun Club - </b>A lightsaber-like Gadget that stuns monkeys, and also harms various other enemies. Swing the right analog stick to swing the club.</li><li><b>Water Net -</b> The only Gadget that can be used underwater. It is automatically switched to when Spike is in water, and can shoot out nets to capture monkeys.</li><li><b>Monkey Radar -</b> A radar that is used to find monkeys. The closer Spike is to a monkey, the faster and higher-pitched the sound it emits will be. Once close enough, the camera can zoom in on the monkey and display a little bio. Rotating the right analog stick rotates the radar dish.</li><li><b>Slingback Shooter/Slingshot -</b> A slingshot that stuns monkeys. Can also harm enemies and hit buttons. Can shoot 3 different types of pellets: Normal, Guided, or Explosive. Pull back on the right analog stick to aim, and let go to shoot.</li><li><b>Super Hoop/Dash Hoop </b>- A hula hoop that gives Spike a speed boost, also allowing him to bowl over enemies. Spin the right analog stick to spin and charge the hoop. Once charged, let go of the stick to activate the boost.</li><li><b>Sky Flyer -</b> A little handheld propeller that allows Spike to rise up in the air. Spin the right analog stick to spin the Sky Flyer, and give Spike lift. Continuous spinning will not keep Spike airborne, but it will slow his descent.</li><li><b>RC Car -</b> A remote controlled car that can fit through small holes. Used to hit unreachable buttons, or to draw monkeys out of hiding. The right analog stick controls the car.</li><li><b>Magic Punch -</b> Obtainable after defeating Specter. An extendable device with what appears to be a boxing glove at the end, it is a powerful Gadget that can destroy boxes and walls that the Stun Club cannot. Tilt the right analog stick slightly for a weak punch, all the way for a strong one.</li></ul><p>Each of the gadgets has its own training room which must be completed to obtain it. These rooms can also be accessed in the warp room.</p><h3>Monkeys</h3><p>Each monkey has different characteristics and requires different tactics to capture them. For example, some monkeys are sleepy, which allows for an easy capture, while some are energetic, requiring the player to run around after them. Some are aggressive, which means that just running up to them could get you furiously punched, and some simply threw banana peels to make you slip. Some even carry firearms. Items have to be used in certain combinations in order to have the monkeys either be backed into a corner or become available to capture. You can also try going for a stealth approach. The lights on their helmets signify their statuses:</p><ul><li><b>Blue</b> - The monkey is calm. Nothing is amiss.</li><li><b>Yellow</b> - The monkey is suspicious and is on alert.</li><li><b>Red</b> - The monkey is alerted to Spike, and will attempt to run away and/or fight back.</li></ul><p>The color of a monkey's pants determines what type of monkey it is. Different strategies are required to catch different monkeys.</p><ul><li><b>Yellow - </b>Regular monkey. They can hit you, throw banannas to make you slip and sometimes they carry a gun.</li><li><b>Red -</b> Strong attacker. They fire rockets at you and also carry machine guns.</li><li><b>Blue</b> - Fast runner. They run really quickly. The dash hoop/super hoop is used to chase them.</li><li><b>White</b> - Great balance. They don't fall over easily.</li><li><b>Green</b> - Great vision. They fire rockets at you and are vigilant. They also wear 3D glasses.</li><li><b>Black</b> - Dangerous and wild. They wear black shades and have machine guns.</li><li><b>Light Blue</b> - Timid and gentle. Similar to a yellow monkey but less aggressive.</li></ul><h2>Plot</h2><p>There once was a monkey named Specter, who happily performed for humans at the zoo. But one day, the Professor accidentally drops one of his inventions, the Peak Point Helmet (Pipo Helmet). Due to curiosity, Specter tries the helmet on, and gains vast amounts of intelligence, and psychic powers. Now believing that humans treat monkeys cruelly, the megalomaniac Specter vows revenge on humans. He amasses an army of monkeys equipped with similar intelligence-boosting helmets (though less powerful than his own), and storms The Professor's lab. He plans to use the Professor's time machine to go back in time, and make monkeys the dominant species on the planet, instead of humans. Just then, Spike and his friend Jake/Buzz barge into the lab, right before Specter makes the leap back in time. He manages to go back in time anyways, as well as kidnapping Jake/Buzz and turning him into a mind-controlled slave. Aided by the Professor, his assistant/granddaughter Natalie/Katie, and his various gadgets, Spike must now go back in time to save Jake/Buzz, round up the rebellious monkeys, and stop Specter from changing history.</p><h2>Controls</h2><p>Since the game requires the Dualshock controller, it allows for a very unique control scheme (for its time). The character is moved with the left thumb stick, and attacks are done with the right stick. The R button is used to jump. The face buttons allow the character to select from a large variety of weapons, everything ranging from a laser sword to a remote controlled car. Attacks are done by moving the right stick in the direction you want to attack. There are also certain weapons that require the attack stick to be spun around quickly, such as a electric hula hoop that once spun fast enough will shoot the player forward quickly. This control scheme was incredibly innovative at the time and made the game much more immersive because it allowed the player to feel like they were much more involved in using the items in the game.</p><h2>Mini Games</h2><p>There are 3 mini games available to unlock in the warp room, each of which is unlocked after you collect a certain amount of Specter Tokens.They all make use of the thumb sticks in unique ways.They are:</p><h3>Ski Kidz Racing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262159\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77111111111111\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262159\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/262159-pre_ape_4_med.jpg\"/></a><figcaption> Spike skiing.</figcaption></figure><p>A racing game where you control your character in a skiing race. There are 5 characters to choose from (Spike, Buzz, Katie, the Professor and Monkey) and it is playable in split-screen for 2 players. You use the thumb sticks to control each of your skis individually. You go faster if you line them up correctly and gain additional boost if they are lined up perfectly. 10 Specter coins are required to unlock it.</p><h3>Specter Boxing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/262158-rev_ape_3_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262158\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75777777777778\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/262158-rev_ape_3_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262158\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/262158-rev_ape_3_med.jpg\"/></a><figcaption> Knockout punch.</figcaption></figure><p>A boxing game where you fight other monkeys in a championship. There are various monkeys to choose from and you fight in a tournament with each match becoming harder as you progress. The thumb sticks are used to control your monkeys fists.

Enemies include expanding pigs, eyes, brown faces, saucers and steel balls. There is a co-op mode as well as a 3 minute time attack mode. 40 Specter tokens are required to unlock it.</p><p> </p><h2>PSP Port</h2><p>In 2005, an updated port of Ape Escape titled <a href=\"/ape-escape-on-the-loose/3030-7961\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7961\">Ape Escape: On the Loose</a> was released for the PSP. It had quite a few control differences, including being able to have only three items at the ready with the Triangle, Circle, and Square buttons as opposed to four on the original version. It changed the title of the level \"Wabi Sabi Wall\" to \"Tiki Tiki Wall\". Also instead of a skiing minigame, it was changed to a snowboarding minigame due to a lack of a second analog stick.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>The levels in Ape Escape are divided into different time zones.</p><h3>The Lost Land</h3><ul><li>Fossil Fields</li><li>Wetlands</li><li>Dinosaur Area</li></ul><h3>Mysterious age</h3><ul><li>Thick Jungle</li><li>Mysterious Ruins 1</li><li>Mysterious Ruins 2</li></ul><h3>Primative Ocean</h3><ul><li>Crabby Beach</li><li>Coral Cave</li><li>Dexter's Island</li></ul><h3>Ice Age</h3><ul><li>Snowy Mammoth</li><li>Frosty Retreat</li><li>Monkey Hot Springs</li></ul><h3>Medieval Mayhem</h3><ul><li>Sushi Temple</li><li>Wabi Sabi Wall</li><li>Crumbling Castle</li></ul><h3>Futurama</h3><ul><li>City Park</li><li>Specter's Factory</li><li>TV Tower</li></ul><h3>Present Day</h3><ul><li>Specter Land</li><li>Final Get<b></b></li></ul>", "deck": "Specter, an evil, super-intelligent monkey, has traveled into the past.

Teamed up they make a force to be reckoned with. However where there are good guys there is always a bad guy and it comes in the form of <a href=\"/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3237\">Chairman Drek</a>. A creepy space alien who wants to take over the universe and that's what you're here to prevent.</p><p>This is essentially a platform game with some basic level designs for you to run around in, these levels are filled with a variety of aliens and robots for you to dispose of in a variety of weird and wonderful ways. You can attack, dodge, blast and tactically jump your way into and out of any situation with an array of crazy weapons at your disposal.</p><p>The combat is 100% open in this game, you can do just about anything you want within reason. Providing you don't die of course, be it a laser to the head or falling off the nearest cliff. There are limitless ways to dispose of enemies, whether you want to use your Morph-O-Ray to turn them into Chickens, or use your <a href=\"/ryno/3055-494\" data-ref-id=\"3055-494\">R.Y.N.O</a> to obliterate all in your path.</p><h2>Storyline</h2><p>On a distant planet, a small robot manages to escape a production plant, only to be shot down while trying to get away in a small shuttle. Meanwhile, on the planet of <a href=\"/planet-veldin/3035-468\" data-ref-id=\"3035-468\">Veldin</a>, <a href=\"/ratchet/3005-120\" data-ref-id=\"3005-120\">Ratchet</a> is working on fixing his own ship at his garage. Suddenly, he spots something falling from the sky, landing not far from where he was working. He finds the small robot and brings it back with him, naming it ' <a href=\"/clank/3005-323\" data-ref-id=\"3005-323\">Clank</a>'.</p><p>When Clank has recovered, he shows Ratchet a message from an Infobot. It features <a href=\"/ultimate-supreme-executive-chairman-drek/3005-3237\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3237\">Chairman Drek</a>, explaining how his home planet of Blarg has become so over-polluted that it is becoming impossible to live there anymore. To solve this problem, Drek reveals his plans - taking large parts from various planets, from across the <a href=\"/solana-galaxy/3035-466\" data-ref-id=\"3035-466\">Solana Galaxy</a>, then combining them into one new area for the Blarg to live. Clank suggest they try to find <a href=\"/captain-qwark/3005-758\" data-ref-id=\"3005-758\">Captain Qwark</a>, the galaxy's most famous hero, to warn him of Drek's plans. Realizing his own planet is under threat, Ratchet agrees.</p><p>During their flight, Ratchet's faulty ship causes trouble again, and they end up crash landing at Novalis. While there, they receive a new ship from a native, and an infobot, containing an ad for Al's Roboshack, featuring Captain Qwark. They then fly on to Metropolis, to meet <a href=\"/big-al/3005-2937\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2937\">Big Al</a>. Although he doesnt know where Qwark is, and hadn't seen him since they filmed the advert, he does upgrade Clank, installing a Heli-Pak.</p><p>Eventually, they do find Qwark, and meet up with him at his challenge course at Umbris. After they complete the course, Qwark traps them, surrounding the pair with lava. Here, he reveals his involvement with Chairman Drek, hoping it will lead to a job oppurtunity on the newly formed planet. He then leaves them to fight a Snagglebeast, expecting they would both be defeated.</p><p>After they escape, Ratchet becomes angry towards Clank, and even more so towards Qwark, vowing to get revenge on the hero. After travelling to many planets, they manage to track down Qwark, defeating him in a space battle. After this, Ratchet sees Drek destroying a nearby planet and realises how un-caring he had become. He then vows to co-operate with Clank to try defeat Drek.</p><p>They gain more information about Drek's plans to use the Deplanetizer, and discover that Ratchet's home planet of Veldin is next in line for destruction. They rush back to the planet, and confront Drek. He proceeds to tell them how it was his plan all along to pollute his home planet, knowing he could make money selling land on the new one. A large battle between him and the duo ensues in which Drek is eventually defeated. Clank notices that the Deplanetizer's position has moved and is now pointing at Blarg, Drek's home planet. Before they can do anything, the machine activates and destroys Blarg.</p><p>After this, the two become overnight celebrities, featured in media across the galaxy.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Over the top weapons became a staple of the series, after the first game introduced some wild and innovative methods of destroying enemies. Unlike later games, Ratchet &amp; Clank didn't feature the ability for weapons to gain experience and upgrade themselves. Instead Gold Bolts could be 'attached' to the player's arsenal to augment the power.</p><p>The weapons available in the game include:</p><ul><li><b>Bomb Glove (Free) Ammo: 40 Bombs</b></li></ul><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1070583\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.73977695167286\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1070583\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/34951/1070583-bomb_glove.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The Bomb Glove</figcaption></figure><p>The Gadgetron Bomb Glove is a staple weapon of the Ratchet and Clank games, with most other titles in the series featuring this weapon or one that is very similar.

In northern Ukuku Prairie is the photo shop, where Link can have his photo taken. Once this has happened, the photo will be placed in the player's very own photo album, entitled \"The Travels of Link.\" From then on the photographer will appear to take photos of various events throughout the game, each of which will be added to the album. These photographs can then be printed off using the Game Boy Printer.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are a total of thirteen photographs in the game, however only twelve can be collected in a given playthrough as the first photograph contains a choice depending on whether or not Link is a willing participant in the photograph. As some of the photographs are of specific scripted events or have specific prerequisites, they can be missed entirely if the player has not obtained the photo album yet, e.g. the photo of Link opening the gate to Kanalet Castle.</p><h2>Virtual Console release</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On 7th/8th May 2011 (the year of Zelda's 25th anniversary), Link's Awakening DX was released on the 3DS <a href=\"/3dsware/3045-138\" data-ref-id=\"3045-138\">eshop</a> as part of it's <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> line-up. As with all Virtual Console releases, this is an exact, complete version of the original cart with no added content or 3D enhancements (though the Game Boy Printer is not compatible with this version). As with all Virtual Console titles, the player has the ability to create restore points when quitting the game, allowing the player to begin right from where they left off at the start of the next play session. Link's Awakening DX is priced at $5.99 in the US, \u00a35.40 in the UK and $9 in AU.</p>", "deck": "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX is a 1998 remake of the 1993 Game Boy game.

Four Sword Adventures was released for the Nintendo <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23\" slug=\"gamecube\">Gamecube</a> in Japan on March 18, 2004 and in North American on June 7, 2004. The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-4\" href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" slug=\"game-boy-advance\">Game Boy Advance</a> can be used as a controller when using the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable bundled in the North America game version.

The game follows the tried and tested formula of other games in the franchise with familiar enemies, items and bosses popping up along the way.</p><h2>Hyrulean Adventure</h2><p>Hyrulean Adventure is the main story mode of the game and it follows the adventures of Link after he has been split into fours. The game can be played in single-player with either the Game Boy Advance or Gamecube controller or with up to four players using the Game Boy Advance only. In single player you take control of the green link and the way you control all four is by selecting different Unit <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1433\" href=\"/unit-formations/3015-1433\" slug=\"unit-formations\">Formations</a>, to solve puzzles or have the Links take turns fighting enemies. In multiplayer each player takes control of one of the different links (green, red, blue, purple) separately. When playing using a Game Boy Advance the action will swap between the screen and the handheld, allowing for you to search areas independently without the other players. The player must battle enemies and work together with the other Links to collect enough force gems and solve puzzles, certain enemies will change colour so that only the corresponding Link can do damage. In this game the player can only carry one item at a time, at certain points in the game different Links will need to be carrying different items. Through the duration of each stage it is required that you collect enough force gems to power up the four sword and you will not be able to complete the stage until you have done this. At certain points in the game you will find a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4912\" href=\"/moon-pearl/3055-4912\" slug=\"moon-pearl\">Moon Pearl</a> which will allow you to travel to the dark world which is represented on your Game Boy Advance screen and is required to advance in some situations. The story consists of eight worlds each with 3 stages and a boss fight to complete at the end.</p><p>In multiplayer mode you can also access the Tingle Tower from the hub world, within this you can complete against the other players in competitive mini-games. There are eight different mini-games to play, you unlock mini-games by completing the second stage of each world. Mini-games range from horse racing to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6079\" href=\"/cucco/3015-6079\" slug=\"cucco\">cucco</a> wrangling. The multiplayer has become famous in some circles for the griefing that can be caused, players can pick up other players and throw them off cliffs or use bombs and fire to kill other players and steal their <a data-ref-id=\"3055-44\" href=\"/rupee/3055-44\" slug=\"rupee\">rupees</a>. At the end of each stage the game rates each player on his performance from first place to fourth place judging them on things such as force gems collected, enemies defeated, lives lost. In addition to this the players are forced to vote on things such as the most helpful player and the most troublesome player in what is the only incentive to prevent you from throwing little Jimmy down a canyon and hogging all the best items.</p><h3>Tingles Tower Mini-games</h3><p>The winner of a mini-game in the tower will be rewarded with a force fairy. Tingle will reward the winner of the game and also the player who collects the most force gems, if one player wins and collects the most force gems then he alone gets rewarded.</p><ol><li>World 1 - Bucking Bronco - A straightforward horse race against the other players.</li><li>World 2 - Cucco Wrangling - In this mini-game the player must catch as many cucco's as possible and throw them into the pen before the time expires.</li><li>World 3 - Hammer Tag - In this game one of the players will randomly be \"on\" and must try and make the other players \"on\" by hitting them with his hammer. In this game you can travel between the dark and light world and if you are the player that is \"on\" you will move faster than all the other Link's.</li><li>World 4 - Monster Hunting - The player who can defeat the most enemies within the time limit wins the game.</li><li>World 5 - Volley, by Golly World - In this game the players play volley ball but you can only hit the ball when the colour corresponds to you.</li><li>6 - Mole Melee - A twist on whack-a-mole where only the designated Link's can hit the corresponding moles.</li><li>World 7 - Monster Hunting Returns - The only upgraded event that is in the tower, in this version there is more enemies and they are harder to kill.</li><li>World 8 - Bonus Level - The last mini-game is a mini dungeon for the players to complete.</li></ol><h2>Shadow Battle</h2><p>Shadow battle is the true competitive mode of Four Sword Adventures, using the Game Boy Advance as a controller two to four players can battle it out as the different coloured Links until only one is left standing. If the time expires and there is more than one link left alive then the match is declared a draw. You can change some of the settings before you battle, for example setting handicaps, turning items off and if you select \"<a data-ref-id=\"3005-852\" href=\"/vaati/3005-852\" slug=\"vaati\">Vaati</a>\" he will appear at the end of the game and throw a giant bomb onto the map. There are 5 different maps for you to choose from in the shadow battle mode and once you have completed the Hyrulean Adventure once it will unlock the dark world versions of these maps. Throughout the battle orbs will appear with items in them for the players to use.</p><h3>Shadow Battle Arena's</h3><p>There are five area's to do battle on in the Shadow Battle mode, after you complete the game the game it will unlock dark world versions of the same arena's.</p><ol><li>The Field - This stage is a grassy stage with a house in the middle. Players have to watch out for traps and hidden objects.</li><li>The Tower of Flames - The main feature of this stage is the lava in the middle which can harm the players.</li><li>Hyrule Castle - A stage in front of Hyrule castle, there are enemies patrolling outside in the light world but you can find items to use in the dark world.</li><li>Tower of the Wind - On this stage players can hide in the dark world and operate switches to drop bombs onto the light world.</li><li>Above the Clouds - On this stage there is a rotating flame jet that will harm the players, there is a lever on the stage that the players can use to change the direction the flames are travelling.</li></ol><h2><b>Story</b></h2><p>The game takes place an undetermined amount of time after the events of four swords. The game begins on a dark night with a stormy cloud and dark feeling covering all of Hyrule, sending people into panic. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5\" href=\"/zelda/3005-5\" slug=\"zelda\">Zelda</a> calls upon Link, and sends him to check on the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4909\" href=\"/four-sword/3055-4909\" slug=\"four-sword\">Four Sword</a>, believing that Vaati has escaped. Zelda then journey's to a temple and calls upon the six maidens to open a portal to the Four Swords Sanctuary. Once the portal was opened, a dark figure of Link appears and seals away the six maidens.

Only Man.</figcaption></figure><p>Bioshock is inspired by themes in Ayn Rand's novel <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. At the time of it's release, Bioshock was lauded by critics for its peerless storytelling and fascinating story. To enhance the story beyond what is directly experienced by the player, Bioshock uses <a href=\"/audio-logs/3015-2038\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2038\">audio diaries</a>. These diaries follow different characters through the rise and fall of the city of <a href=\"/rapture/3035-66\" data-ref-id=\"3035-66\">Rapture</a>. At times, ghosts will also appear in the city showing very brief fragments of the actions of certain citizens of Rapture. Bioshock is also well known for not taking player control away during scripted events, allowing the player to experience literally everything through the eyes of the protagonist.</p><p>The player does not directly see any of the coup of Rapture in BioShock, instead arriving sometime afterward in the year 1960, discovering a desolate city filled with insane, drug-addled citizens. The player hears about Rapture's golden era--and the events that led to its demise--through a series of audio logs that serve as diary entries for the past inhabitants of the city. Touted by <a href=\"/2k-games/3010-360\" data-ref-id=\"3010-360\">2K</a> as an \"FPS-RPG\" and a \" <a href=\"/spiritual-successor/3015-425\" data-ref-id=\"3015-425\">spiritual sequel</a>\" to <a href=\"/2k-boston/3010-4951\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4951\">Irrational's</a> highly revered <a href=\"/system-shock-2/3030-8870\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8870\">System Shock 2</a>, it has gameplay similarities to both <a href=\"/system-shock/3025-313\" data-ref-id=\"3025-313\">System Shock</a> games as well as <a href=\"/deus-ex/3030-17533\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17533\">Deus Ex</a>. It is possibly an indictment of the current gaming generation that BioShock has been lauded as such an original game, when in fact it copies so many structural elements from said predecessors' gameplay (such as non-linear player-character development, moral choice in plot progression, immersive setting and story).</p><p>To its credit, however, BioShock is more of an exploration-focused <a href=\"/first-person/3015-330\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person</a> shooter that makes streamlined, simplified use of some of its predecessors' mechanics, such as the use of audio logs as a storytelling device, a hacking <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigame</a> (reminiscent of the classic puzzler <a href=\"/pipe-dream/3030-2779\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2779\">Pipe Dream</a>), and special abilities. While being primarily built on <a href=\"/unreal-engine-25/3015-992\" data-ref-id=\"3015-992\">Unreal Engine 2.5</a>, BioShock is also one of the first games to be produced using features from <a href=\"/epic-games/3010-149\" data-ref-id=\"3010-149\">Epic's</a> <a href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86\" data-ref-id=\"3015-86\">Unreal Engine 3</a> and appeared on both the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>. On October 17, 2008 Bioshock was released for the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>. This version of the game features a new 'Survivor' difficulty mode as well as other in-game add-on content. Downloadable \"challenge rooms\" are also available; these put the player in a race against the clock while working through brief, <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzle-oriented</a> levels. The Playstation 3 version ships with Trophy Support, just as the Xbox 360 version, of course, contains <a href=\"/achievements/3015-29\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">Achievements</a>.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/927235-screenshot_27_xl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927235\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/927235-screenshot_27_xl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927235\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/927235-screenshot_27_xl.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Welcome to Rapture.</figcaption></figure><p>Set in 1960, BioShock begins with a plane crash, with the player character, named <a href=\"/jack/3005-4149\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4149\">Jack</a>, being the only survivor. The player takes refuge in a lone lighthouse in the middle of the ocean. A <a href=\"/bathysphere/3055-719\" data-ref-id=\"3055-719\">bathysphere</a> leads down into the bowels of the <a href=\"/underwater/3035-719\" data-ref-id=\"3035-719\">underwater</a> city of <a href=\"/rapture/3035-66\" data-ref-id=\"3035-66\">Rapture</a>. A message from the city's creator, <a href=\"/andrew-ryan/3005-424\" data-ref-id=\"3005-424\">Andrew Ryan</a>, talks of his vision for Rapture, a utopia without ethical or moral barriers. However, from the looks of things, Ryan has failed in realizing his vision.</p><p>A man named <a href=\"/atlas/3005-925\" data-ref-id=\"3005-925\">Atlas</a> contacts Jack in the bathysphere and helps to lead him through the city, which is filled with genetically modified <a href=\"/splicers/3015-647\" data-ref-id=\"3015-647\">Splicers</a>, <a href=\"/little-sisters/3015-1111\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1111\">Little Sisters</a>, and their guardians, the <a href=\"/big-daddy/3015-624\" data-ref-id=\"3015-624\">Big Daddies</a>. Atlas also tells Jack about <a href=\"/adam/3015-43\" data-ref-id=\"3015-43\">ADAM</a>, stem cells harvested to enhance the abilities of the human body. The abuse of ADAM has driven the Splicers mad and the material is what the Little Sisters constantly search for throughout Rapture.</p><p>Atlas instructs Jack to kill the Little Sisters and take the ADAM from them in order to use special abilities called <a href=\"/plasmid/3055-24\" data-ref-id=\"3055-24\">Plasmids</a>. However, another ally in Rapture, <a href=\"/bridgette-tenenbaum/3005-1072\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1072\">Dr. Tenenbaum</a>, tells Jack to save the Little Sisters and promises to reward him if he obeys.</p><p>Atlas soon tells Jack of his wife and child, who are hiding from Splicers in a submarine. When Jack reaches them, however, Andrew Ryan destroys it, supposedly killing Atlas' family. Atlas, enraged, asks Jack to kill Andrew Ryan.</p><p>Jack reaches Andrew Ryan, who reveals that Jack is actually his son and was born in Rapture two years prior. Genetic modification allowed for him to age rapidly. One of Rapture's pioneers, <a href=\"/atlas/3005-925\" data-ref-id=\"3005-925\">Frank Fontaine</a>, \"programmed\" Jack to obey any order uttered with the phrase \"Would you kindly\", a phrase that Atlas has repeated many times. Jack was the one who crashed the plane and was brought to Rapture on purpose, with the goal of killing Andrew Ryan.</p><p>Ryan orders Jack to kill him, using the phrase \"Would you kindly.\" Forced to obey, Jack kills Ryan with a golf club. Shortly after, Atlas reveals himself to be Frank Fontaine and leaves Jack to die in the city. Dr. Tenenbaum saves him, though, and deactivates the \"Would you kindly\" trigger phrase control Fontaine has over him. Jack then proceeds to Olympus Heights and finds Lot 192 which reverses a heart stopping mental control Fontaine was attempting to kill Jack with. Tenenbaum then instructs Jack to don a Big Daddy suit so the Little Sisters can lead him to Fontaine. When he reaches him, Fontaine, pumped up by massive quantities of ADAM, has acquired almost superhuman abilities.</p><p>Upon defeating Fontaine, three endings are possible. If the player rescues all the Little Sisters, the game ends with Jack and the Little Sisters leaving Rapture and the girls growing up to live their lives. If the player harvested two or more, but not all the Little Sisters, Jack kills the Little Sisters and takes their ADAM. If the player harvests all of the Little Sisters, the same ending is shown but with Tenenbaum's narration being angrier.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102336-25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-102336\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102336-25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-102336\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102336-25.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/102336-25.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Gunning it with a Big Daddy.</figcaption></figure><p>The game features an array of traditional weapons that can be acquired throughout the game.

Everything from security bots to safes can be hacked. Hacking machines can help you evade security systems, supply you with hidden items, and give you discounts on items at vending machines.</p><p><a href=\"/hacking/3015-1154\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1154\">Hacking</a> is done with the hacking mini-game, which is highly reminiscent of the classic computer game <a href=\"/pipe-dream/3030-2779\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2779\">Pipe Mania</a> (<i>Pipe Dream</i> in the United States). The goal is to successfully move fluid through a tube set on a grid of tiles from a starting location to and ending location, both of which are just outside the grid and, thus, not modifiable by the player. The player reveals pieces of the tube one at a time and may swaps tiles to continue the tube and keep the fluid moving. If the fluid is hindered in its progress either due to player error or by hitting certain tiles such as overload tiles and security tiles, the mini-game is failed and, depending on the gravity of the failure, security bots may be deployed to eliminate the player. An auto-hack tool can allow for a hack without using the mini-game. Hacking ability is greatly enhanced and simplified through the strategic equipment of certain engineering tonics. Also, the Winter Blast plasmid used on a machine just before hacking will slow the progress of the fluid considerably.</p><h2>Vending Machines / Kiosks</h2><p>Various <a href=\"/vending-machine/3055-200\" data-ref-id=\"3055-200\">vending machines</a> and kiosks are found throughout the game. The different types are as follows:</p><ul><li>Circus of Value: A place to purchase a variety of items.

This only works with the main character Jack and the explanation to why it doesn't work for splicers is that it was in its testing phase when Rapture fell. Vita-Chambers serve as a <a href=\"/checkpoints/3015-292\" data-ref-id=\"3015-292\">checkpoint</a> of sorts, even though the game can also be saved at any time through the start menu. Unlike traditional checkpoints, enemies injured or killed since reaching the Vita-Chamber will remain so when the player is respawned. However, weapon ammunition will remain at the same level as when the player was killed and the player is also given only a fraction of his maximum health. Since there is seemingly no penalty for using Vita-Chambers many players have bemoaned this design decision for making the game too easy \u2014 given enough time and patience, a player wielding only the wrench can slog his or her way through even the toughest battles.</p><h3>Moral Choice</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/505710-bioshock2_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505710\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 404px\" data-ratio=\"0.56188118811881\" data-width=\"404\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6436/505710-bioshock2_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-505710\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6436/505710-bioshock2_0.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6436/505710-bioshock2_0.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Little Sister</figcaption></figure><p>Near the beginning of the game, the player is given the choice of either harvesting the Little Sisters (effectively killing them) to gain a large amount of ADAM, or rescuing the Little Sisters for a significantly smaller amount of ADAM. Rescuing Little Sisters will, however, allow the player to access certain plasmids and Xbox 360 achievements unavailable through the \"evil\" method of play, and for each 3 that you rescue you will receive a gift from Dr. Tenenbaum. Depending on exactly how many Little Sisters you harvest or rescue, the game's ending is affected. If you save all the Little Sisters you get a one hundred point achievement.</p><h3>Security</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1836466-bioshock_security_camera.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1836466\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.4030769230769\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1836466-bioshock_security_camera.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1836466\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1836466-bioshock_security_camera.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11986/1836466-bioshock_security_camera.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>A hostile security camera. Hacked cameras have a green light instead of red</figcaption></figure><p>Jack has to deal with the security of Rapture throughout Bioshock. The security force includes cameras, turrets, and flying bots called Security Bots. All three of these can either be destroyed or hacked by Jack to get them on his side. Hacked turrets and bots will automatically fire on enemies, and hacked cameras will target enemies and trigger the alarm against them (which causes a wave of bots to come flying in and attack them). In addition, there is a Plasmid called \"Security Bullseye\" that, when thrown onto an enemy, will cause cameras and turrets to target said enemy.</p><p>All three types of security forces can be temporarily disabled by zapping them with the Electro Bolt or Winter Blast plasmid. Turrets and bots must be hit with the Electro Bolt or Winter Blast before being hacked; security cameras do not.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The original story for Bioshock was drastically different. It centered around a deprogrammer, someone who forces a person to abandon religious or social group allegiances. The main character's mission was to rescue someone from a cult and adjust them mentally to a regular life. However, the plot underwent significant changes by the time development on the game was announced in 2004. At that time, the game's setting was changed to a World War II-era underground laboratory. When the laboratory was uncovered by scientists in the 21st century, they discovered an ecosystem formed by the experiments in the lab.</p><p>The developers used a heavily modified version of the Unreal Engine 2.5. They also hired a water programmer and water artist to create the stunning water effects seen in the game. Bioshock also uses the Havok physics engine for more lifelike ragdoll effects.</p><h2>Plasmids</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1556689-140px_plasmid.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1556689\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 140px\" data-ratio=\"1.4214285714286\" data-width=\"140\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1556689-140px_plasmid.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1556689\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1556689-140px_plasmid.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1556689-140px_plasmid.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Open bottle for Plasmid</figcaption></figure><p>Plasmids change your character's genetic information and provide him with specific abilities.

However, if the game was installed under the preliminary (first release) version of the NXE, Bioshock takes up 6.1 GB of space. This is true even if the user has since updated their Xbox 360's dashboard to a newer version. The only way to take advantage of the smaller size is to delete the old installation and re-install the game.</p><h2>Artbook</h2><p>On March 16, 2009 the Cult of Rapture website announced that a limited edition artbook for Bioshock called <i>Breaking the Mold: Developer's Edition</i> was available for pre-order on the 2K online store. The standard version can be found on the Cult of Rapture website for download as a PDF file.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>Originally 2K Designed a Teleportation Plasmid that teleported the player out of danger, by marking a location that the player would teleport to when they used the plasmid, the plasmid was ultimately removed due to the fact that it could be used to break story events. A same sort of teleport plasmid did appear in <a href=\"/bioshock-2/3030-20827\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20827\">Bioshock 2</a> as an <a href=\"/easter-egg/3015-2\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2\">Easter Egg</a>, presumably based on the plasmid scrapped from Bioshock 1.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Games on Demand</h2><p>On August 6, 2009, BioShock became available on the Xbox 360's <a href=\"/games-on-demand/3015-3251\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3251\">Games on Demand</a> service.

You play as <a href=\"/corvo-attano/3005-23124\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23124\">Corvo Attano</a>, the Lord Protector of the Empress of Dunwall. Her murder triggers a quest for revenge in which the player is tasked with assassinating various targets. The game presents a wide array of options for completing each mission while maintaining a challenge through unpredictable enemy behavior.</p><p>Although revenge is the driving force behind the narrative of Dishonored, the game offers complete freedom in how the player wishes to tackle every major objective. In fact, you can complete the game without being detected and/or killing anyone.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161989/2341918-dishonored5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2341918\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/16/161989/2341918-dishonored5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2341918\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/16/161989/2341918-dishonored5.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>There are multiple ways to approach each level.</figcaption></figure><p>Dishonored offers an experience that can be vastly different depending on how the player chooses to play it. They can be a ghost, never being seen or heard as they complete your objectives; the assassin, leaving a trail of dead bodies in their wake, or a combination thereof. These choices are applied to the main assassination targets, as well. There is always a non-lethal option for the main target in a mission, but it requires a lot of extra effort from the player. Players have both health and mana bars that are refilled through consumption of potions, but mana will regenerate to a point based on how quickly they are using their magic based skills.</p><p>The story of Dishonored progresses in a linear fashion, but every mission in the story is its own sandbox, open to exploration. The rooftops, sewers, and even the ocean are explorable. Each mission is filled with secret areas and pathways, and there are usually a few NPCs to find that offer side-missions.</p><h3>Chaos System</h3><p>Dishonored keeps track of the player's actions with a \"Chaos\" system. The more the player chooses to kill, the more rats and plague victims will be roaming the city. The Chaos system also affects the story of Dishonored, making it much darker in tone if the player has killed many people.</p><h3>Skills and abilities</h3><p>Corvo is granted some unique abilities by the Outsider that are unlocked through the exchange of Runes. Runes are scattered across the various maps and unlock different skills based on their choice of how to play the game. Skills have two tiers, with the second being more expensive than the first, so players can have a few powerful skills, or an array of weaker ones. Choice in skills is permanent, so decisions on what skills to use must be made carefully.</p><ul><li><b>Blink:</b> The most important skill in Corvo's arsenal, this allows the player to teleport short distances both horizontally and vertically, though there is a distance penalty for vertical blinking. Level 2 increases blink distance significantly.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Dark Vision:</b> This skill reveals the outlines of being through walls including their line of sight. Level 2 also shows security systems and valuable objects.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Possession:</b> Allows players to take control of living things in their immediate vicinity for a short time, enabling them to travel through small spaces or hide. Level 2 allows players to possess humans.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Bend Time:</b> Slows down time for a short period, useful in both stealth and combat situations. Level 2 allows the player to stop time completely for a shorter duration.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Devouring Swarm:</b> Summons a pack of rats to attack the nearest living thing or eat nearby corpses to prevent future detection. Level 2 is a larger, more vicious swarm of rats.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Windblast:</b> Summons of gust of wind that will knock over enemies, douse fires, shatter wood and glass, and deflect enemy projectiles. Level 2 is a stronger gust.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Shadow Kill:</b> Turns stealth killed enemies to dust to prevent future detection by their comrades. Level 2 allows all killed enemies to be turned to dust.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Blood Thirsty:</b> Allows blocks and kills to build adrenaline, which once maxed allows Corvo to provide a devastating attack. Level 2 speeds up the rate of adrenaline and makes for a double attack which can kill multiple enemies.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Agility</b>: Enables players to jump higher. Level 2 allows them to run faster.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Vitality:</b> Increases maximum health. Level 2 allows for some health regeneration.</li></ul><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2283592\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2283592\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/49445/2283592-au9bp.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Corvo with pistol and sword.</figcaption></figure><p>In Dishonored the player is always dual wielding, holding the sword in the player character's right hand and an item or spell in their left. Kills can be done in a detected or stealth mode, allowing for different play styles. In detected combat players can block opponents attacks, which leaves them open for deadly slashes or stabs, or simply slash and use gadgets to reach victory. Stealth kills require the player to sneak up undetected behind their target which will allow them to use lethal or nonlethal takedowns. A lethal take down is quicker while players must choke their victim during a non-lethal takedown. Players can also perform jumping assassinations from high locations onto lower platforms without taking damage. Combat is a completely avoidable scenario throughout most of the game.</p><p>Enemies in Dishonored often use the same tools as the player. Common enemies carry nothing but a sword or a club, while higher ranking enemies carry a gun or a crossbow, as well as a melee weapon. There are also enemies that have access to magic, though they are very rarely seen.</p><h3>Stealth</h3><p>There are a number of options for playing stealthily. Pressing the crouch button will darken the edges of the screen, indicating that \"Stealth Mode\" is enabled. While Stealth Mode is enabled, the sounds of player movement are muffled, and hiding in the shadows will reduce a nearby NPC's sight range. There is a lean function which allows for peaking around corners without the possibility of being spotted. Keyholes on closed doors can be peeked through to scout out a room before proceeding. Loose objects can be picked up and thrown to create a noisy distraction. The short sword can also be used to create distractions by bashing it against solid objects.</p><h3>Weapons and Gadgets</h3><ul><li><b>Sword:</b> Used for melee and stealth combat, it is also used in blocking. The primary tool in Corvo's arsenal and thus is always equipped.</li><li><b>Pistol:</b> For ranged takedowns, very loud. Can be equipped with explosive ammo.</li><li><b>Crossbow:</b> Handheld crossbow is a silent, single shot killer. Can be loaded with incendiary and non-lethal sleep darts.</li><li><b>Grenades</b>: Thrown explosive useful for large groups of enemies. There is a sticky variation as well.</li><li><b>Springrazor:</b> Proximity mine that launches razors in the general vicinity, ripping targets to shreds. Can be attached to walls, doors, and creatures.</li><li><b>Heart:</b> Detects Bone-Charms and Runes in the area</li><li><b>Rewire tools:</b> Allow Corvo to rewire traps and security systems on his enemies.</li><li><b>Bone-Charms:</b> Magic charms that are slotted to provide passive bonuses.</li></ul><h3>Upgrades</h3><p>While in the hub area, Corvo can fully upgrade his equipment by talking to an inventor named Piero. There are several upgrades to choose from, including accuracy and damage of ranged weapons, or an increase to the amount of grenades that can be carried. All of this is done with coinage that is found throughout the missions. Equipment will change visually, as well, as different parts are upgraded/modified. Some upgrades can only be gained after finding blueprints, which are obtainable through black market merchants or found on missions.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Designer <a href=\"/viktor-antonov/3040-14115\" data-ref-id=\"3040-14115\">Viktor Antonov</a> wanted to blend a variety of time periods into a singular cohesive world, taking inspiration from <i>Gormenghast</i> by Mervyn Peake.

Having just returned from a trip overseas, the Empress, not long after being reunited with Corvo, is assassinated while <a href=\"/emily-kaldwin/3005-24580\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24580\">Emily</a> is kidnapped, Corvo being framed for both. As a result he is imprisoned and sentenced to be executed. The mastermind of the plot, the shadowy Lord Regent, becomes the head of state in the Empress's absence.</p><p>An underground resistance movement seeks Corvo's aid, and there is much to be gained in return. Corvo must become the fist of vengeance for his fallen Empress and ensure the safety of Emily by assassinating or disabling allies of the Lord Regent, and eventually installing Emily as the new Empress before the Lord Regent gains complete control of the country.</p><p>The setting for this story is a steampunk universe; more specifically, the port city of Dunwall, separated from other nearby archipelagos by monster-infested waters. The main power source of the world is whale oil, a product that in the past had made Dunwall a wealthy trading hub. Political tensions run high, however, and due to a plague that has wiped out over half of the city, other countries refuse to help and eventually embargo the once powerful city. The plague is transmitted by rats who run rampant throughout the city, spreading the sickness to those that cannot afford the expensive elixirs that treat the malady. Much of the city is in ruins because of the plague, with victims wandering the derelict streets, while other parts are under martial law to prevent the spread. The population is oppressed by both financial and military constraints, hence many have turned to religion or black magic.</p><p>Corvo is a <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> professional and beside his natural talent and new-found supernatural powers, he also has the ability to bend time, and \"<a href=\"/possession/3015-819\" data-ref-id=\"3015-819\">possess</a>\" living things, allowing players to take control and play as them for a short amount of time. Most important of these powers is the Blink spell, which allows the player to traverse the map both vertically and horizontally. These powers were granted to Corvo by a figure known only as <a href=\"/the-outsider/3005-24710\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24710\">The Outsider</a>. This supernatural being is the source of all magic in the world. Its nature, origins, and intentions are all shrouded by mystery.</p><p>The story will change depending on the decisions players make: the more death that Corvo causes, the grimmer the final outlook of the game. Similar to the <a href=\"/deus-ex/3025-146\" data-ref-id=\"3025-146\">Deus Ex franchise</a>, the game will require players to make tough choices without breaking the flow of gameplay, while giving the player a limited amount of time to do so.</p><h2>Downloadable Content (Single-Player Plot Add-On)</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2454693\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2454693\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7030/2454693-1375813628-disho.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>\"The Knife of Dunwall\" has players taking on the role of Daud, whose assassination of a key figure in Dunwall sets the core story of the game into motion.

Blazkowicz</a>, along with his squadmates <a href=\"/fergus-reid/3005-29500\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29500\">Fergus Reid </a>and <a href=\"/probst-wyatt-iii/3005-29501\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29501\">Probst Wyatt</a> manage to breach the compound but are captured by General Deathshead.</p><p>Deathshead forces Blazkowicz to choose which of his squadmates will live. Deathshead says that he will take the other's eyes for use in a medical experiment. After being forced to witness the dissection of the squadmate the player has condemned to death, Deathshead attempts to kill them both as well using the room's incinerator. However, both characters escape. In their escape Blazkowicz is wounded by a piece of shrapnel in the skull, falling into the ocean unconscious.</p><p>Blazkowicz is pulled from the sea by Polish fishermen, and based on the fact he is unable to speak or move, he is sent to an asylum run by the Oliwa family. As the Nazis grow in power, defeating other nations, their visits to the asylum for 'specimens' become more frequent, as shown in the game's introductory cutscene. The game begins when a group arrive in 1960, proclaiming that the asylum is to be liquidated. The Nazis begin to shoot the inmates; when the staff resist, they too are shot. This moment sparks Blazkowicz's 'reactivation', for he becomes aware of his surroundings again and kills his way out of the asylum, saving <a href=\"/anya-oliwa/3005-29499\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29499\">Anya Oliwa</a> in the process. Together, they are the only survivors from the asylum.</p><p>Blazkowicz spends time with Anya's grandparents in Poland, learning that the Nazis rule the world and the United States, as Fergus had predicted, would surrender. In the game's timeline, the USA surrendered in 1948 after the Nazis dropped atomic bombs. Resistance has been all but crushed, and the few who have resisted the regime are held in Berlin's Eisenwald Prison: built in the late 1940s, it is notable as there have been no escapees in its history. Anya and Blazkowicz, with the aid of her grandparents, make it to a train bound for Berlin.</p><p>Aboard the train Blazkowicz is confronted by <a href=\"/frau-engel/3005-29498\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29498\">Frau Engel</a> and Hans Winkle, whom is referred to throughout the game as 'Bubi'. Engel forces Blazkowicz to engage in a Rorschach-esque test, choosing pictures linked to feelings of sadness and other emotions. She claims that, through this test, she is able to spot a true Aryan, and informs Blazkowicz that failing the test will result in him being shot. He manages to survive the encounter, and arrives in Berlin with Anya.</p><p>Upon arriving in Berlin, Blazkowicz breaches Eisenwald's perimeter by climbing onto the roof of the prison bus and accessing the roof. He is reunited with the squadmate who the player chose to spare in the opening mission, and subsequently introduced to the resistance movement headed by his old ally <a href=\"/caroline-becker/3005-29503\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29503\">Caroline Becker</a>.</p><p>Blazkowicz's first action with the resistance is the theft of three stealth helicopters in London, with the aid of resistance member Bobby Bram, who acts as a <a href=\"/suicide/3015-1408\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1408\">suicide bomber</a>. During the attack on the research facility, Blazkowicz steals files relating to the secret Da'at Yichud organization. These files explain how the Nazis managed to build the monolithic concrete structures that dominate their cities: a substance Anya dubs \u00dcberconcrete. They discover that a member of the group, Set Roth, is being helped at the Belica concentration camp.</p><p>Blazkowicz is sent in to find Roth and extract him from the camp. It transpires that <a href=\"/frau-engel/3005-29498\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29498\">Frau Engel</a> runs the camp, with Bubi as her second in command. While undercover in the camp Blazkowicz kills a sadistic guard known as 'The Knife', having been captured and tortured. He recovers valuable technology that Roth requires to engineer their escape, but when Engel learns of The Knife's death, she demands the immediate execution of all prisoners in Block 6. Seconds before their execution, Roth seizes control of one of the prison guard robots, known as \"Herr Faust\". Using Faust, he kills the executioners and seriously disfigures Engel.</p><p>Once the prisoners are safely secured from Belica, they hide with the resistance movement under the Reich's capital city, Berlin. Roth helps the group secure knowledge from Da'at Yichud held in a storehouse in the Atlantic Ocean. To gain this valuable knowledge, Blazkowicz steals a Nazi <a href=\"/submarine/3055-828\" data-ref-id=\"3055-828\">U-Boat</a> and the group finds the storehouse. Here they discover a type of armor with a neural interface that enables <a href=\"/caroline-becker/3005-29503\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29503\">Caroline </a>to walk despite being disabled. The submarine stolen was one of the nuclear variants; according to Fergus 'Eva's Hammer' the \"pride of the Reich's fleet\". With the commander having been killed the group cannot fire any of the nuclear missiles in its cargo: the Nazis store the codes in the lunar based opened on the moon.</p><p>In order to gain access to the lunar base, the resistance attacks a train carrying Deathshead's chief scientist. With his identity, Blazkowicz is able to gain access to the lunar base, where he is welcomed by the Nazis. They congratulate him on his success and make reference to the previous head, but Blazkowicz acquires weapons and systematically makes his way through the base and across the moon's surface in order to acquire the nuclear codes.</p><p>Upon returning to earth in a stolen cargo-ship, Blazkowicz is shot down by the London Nautica, from which he had previously stolen the stealth helicopters. While fighting his way out of Berlin, Fergus informs him that the resistance hideout has been found and Deathshead has sent one of his elite units to eliminate them all. After destroying the monolithic London Monitor robot, Blazkowicz escapes Nazi-controlled England and returns to Berlin, where he fights alongside the remaining members of the resistance to eliminate the Nazi attackers.</p><p>In an act targeted at Blazkowicz in particular, Deathshead has taken <a href=\"/anya-oliwa/3005-29499\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29499\">Anya </a>and Set Roth to his own compound, near the Baltic Sea. With the hideout having been destroyed and their numbers drastically cut down, the resistance launches a last-ditch attack on Deathshead's own compound. The captured members are freed and told to escape the compound aboard one of the resistance stealth helicopters. Blazkowicz is not able to escape, and chooses to face Deathshead and settle an old debt.</p><p>Before Deathshead opts to fight Blazkowicz, he informs him of what he did with the dead squadmate's brain - he used it as the basis for one of his robots, claiming it to have the \"intelligence of the human brain and the obedience of machinery\". Despite trying to fight with Blazkowicz, the robot pleads with him to kill it, which he does by removing the brain both from the robot and from Deathshead's containment chamber.</p><p>Seeing the prototype robot has been destroyed, Deathshead attacks aboard his own robot. While the prototype may have been the latest and greatest weapon in the Nazi arsenal, Deathshead's personal robot has been made even more deadly, featuring a shield as well as more guns. Blazkowicz ultimately destroys this robotic creation, pulling the stricken General from its wreckage and stabbing him repeatedly. In one last act of desperation, Deathshead pulls the pin on a grenade, killing himself and seriously wounding Blazkowicz.</p><p>Though seriously wounded Blazkowicz ensures all of the freed resistance members have escaped before he calls in the nuclear missile aboard Eva's Hammer. His act is one of sacrifice; without the helicopter it is not clear how he could escape Deathshead's compound himself. The game fades to black and the credits roll.</p><p>However, at the end of the credits the sound of a helicopter becomes louder, potentially implying that the nuclear missile was never launched and Blazkowicz was saved.</p><p> </p><h2>German Censorship</h2><p>Under German law it is illegal to display the swastika for non-historical purposes, meaning that German copies of the game do not contain swastikas or the 'Sig' runes adopted by the SS. The swastika is replaced by the Wolfenstein logo, while the Sig runes are replaced with a triangle. Surprisingly, the gore in-game remains intact despite players being able to - among other things - decapitate Nazis, sever their limbs, and (should they so desire) blow dogs up with grenades.</p><p> </p><h2>Collectables</h2><p>The game contains a wide variety of collectibles, some unlock new game modes or increased health and armor pools, while others are merely for completion. With the 'scout' perk, silently killing an enemy officer marks the location of all the collectibles hidden in the chapter.</p><h3>Enigma Codes</h3><p>Every level has a series of Enigma codebooks, gathering all of the pieces of a codebook unlocks a cypher which, when solved, unlocks a new game mode.</p><h3>Nazi Gold</h3><p>Each level contains a number of pieces of gold in the shape of various objects from the franchise, they serve no purpose other than to be collected.</p><h3>Records</h3><p>Each of the three chapters which take place in the resistance HQ (chapters 5,7,and 9) have a hidden record; each unlocks a re-imagined song written in the style of a classic 60's band or musician.</p><h3>Health / Armor Powerups</h3><p>Choosing Fergus in the first level of the game will branch the story along the 'Fergus Timeline', while choosing Wyatt will branch the story along the 'Wyatt Timeline'. Depending on the timeline the pick-ups found will vary: health power-ups appear along the Fergus Timeline. When they are collected, player health is increased by 10. Choosing the Wyatt Timeline will replace these health pick-ups with armor pick-ups, increasing the amount of damage negated per armor point.</p><h3>Letters</h3><p>There are a number of letters hidden throughout the game which provide details and lore on the dark alternate timeline of the game. These letters are written by various individuals inhabiting the world under Nazi control.</p><h3>Journal Recordings</h3><p>Throughout the game <a href=\"/anya-oliwa/3005-29499\" data-ref-id=\"3005-29499\">Anya </a>will automatically give you recorded readings of her cousin Ramona's diary, where she chronicles her vigilante attacks against the Nazi soldiers occupying her town. According to Anya, the diary was originally written in Polish. Dates on the entries refer to the early years of the Second World War, when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_resistance_movement_in_World_War_II\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Polish resistance movement</a> would have been operating effectively. The final record is dated to 1960.</p><p>Ramona's diary entries discuss her acts against the Nazis and her efforts to kill soldiers in a clandestine manner as well as the growing support for the Nazis among her own family and friends. The first entry justifies her attacks, as the Nazi soldiers killed a friend of hers. Her first kill is dated to June 25, 1940, when she stabs a soldier to death and records how he whimpered for his mother.</p><p> </p><h2>Promotional Methods</h2><h3>Records</h3><p>All cultural landmarks following the Nazi conquest of earth have been reshaped or suppressed to suit the Nazi ideology, as can be seen in the game's collectible records. Three records can be found in-game, and are recordings of real-world music in German.</p><p>The tracks are found on the fictional \"Neumond Recordings\" label (New Moon Recordings) and can be bought through iTunes.</p><p>The tracks are as follows, and were used for pre-release promotion. The tracks by Ralph Becker and Die Partei Fraue are also not included among the Neumond Recordings. Curiously one of the tracks collected in-game - Die K\u00e4fer's track \"Das blaue U-Boat\" - is not among those available on iTunes either.</p><p>None of the tracks feature any obvious Nazi symbols. Where these would be otherwise present they have been replaced by the Wolfenstein logo, with the most obvious example being The Bunkers' track \"Toe the Line\".</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Track Name (German)</th><th scope=\"col\">Track Name (English)</th><th scope=\"col\">Album Covers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>\"Mond Mond, Ja Ja\" - Die K\u00e4fer</td><td>\"Moon Moon, Yes, Yes\" - The Beatles (lit.

He finds himself in a castle in 1840s Brennenburg, and all that he seems to be able to remember is his name, the fact that he lives in London and that something called a shadow is hunting him down.

Seeing and being involved in disturbing events in the game will drain his sanity, eventually leaving him with hallucinations and impaired movement and vision. Dips in Daniel's sanity allow the supernatural to spot him quickly. Sanity stops draining when in lit areas, and it regenerates to a healthy state if Daniel solves a puzzle. The sanity system can be considered similar to the one found in <a href=\"/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/3030-7512\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7512\">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem.</a> However sanity cannot explicitly lead to killing the player, unlike physical health.</p><p>The game utilizes a lighting system which affects the sanity of a character (darkness being detrimental to Daniel's sanity). The player collects and refills their <a href=\"/lantern/3055-1978\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1978\">lantern</a>, which helps light the way, but also collects tinderboxes to light <a href=\"/torch/3055-484\" data-ref-id=\"3055-484\">torches</a> or <a href=\"/candle/3055-814\" data-ref-id=\"3055-814\">candles</a>. The lighting system creates a balance between maintaining sanity and hiding from elements of danger.</p><figure style=\"width: 480px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1638154-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.03.25_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638154\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1638154-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.03.25_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638154\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57879/1638154-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.03.25_am.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The inventory screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the lighting ties heavily into the <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> aspect of the game. Daniel has no means of defence, so the game explicitly states to the player at the start of the game that they should use their wits instead. This can include staying in the dark and moving carefully at the cost of his sanity, or using the environment to create distractions (such as by throwing a bottle to make a noise), and running away when spotted. This is the style typical of the developer <a href=\"/frictional-games/3010-2417\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2417\">Frictional Games</a>' <a href=\"/penumbra/3025-1219\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1219\">Penumbra</a> franchise.</p><p>Along the journey, the player can collect notes that offer insight into the story but also help solve puzzles. Puzzles range from simply combining items to puzzles that span of numerous rooms.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure style=\"width: 480px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1703848-a12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1703848\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/101494/1703848-a12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1703848\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101494/1703848-a12.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101494/1703848-a12.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The gloomy wine cellar.</figcaption></figure><p>In an effort to recover his lost memory, Daniel proceeds through the halls of Castle Brennenburg. He finds a page from his own journal that explains that he must find and kill the Baron <a href=\"/alexander-of-brennenburg/3005-17785\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17785\">Alexander of Brennenburg</a>. The note also explains that Daniel is being pursued by what can only be described as a sentient nightmare that cannot be harmed in any meaningful way.</p><p>As Daniel makes progress into the Castle's entrance hall, he is greeted with a flashback that details a tidbit of a conversation between what appears to be himself and another individual. It becomes clear that Daniel is to follow the red rose petals that litter the ground. Just as he begins to do so, a large fleshy wall impedes his progress.</p><p>Daniel then decides to explore the laboratory. Once there, he discovers a note that explains that someone has locked a party of men in the wine cellar. Daniel decides that this is to be his next stop. After obtaining the key to enter the cellar from the archive room, he enters the incredibly gloomy wine cellar. The aforementioned party of men has, as expected, long since expired, and their remains litter the floor. Among them, a note is found explaining that they delivered hundreds of innocent men, women, and children to the Baron in exchange for political advancement.</p><p>Daniel returns to the laboratory to create a chemical compound using the components he discovered in the cellar. With this acidic compound in hand, he returns to the entrance hall to splash it on the flesh wall. Sure enough, he evaporates the wall opening a path.</p><p>This path takes Daniel to the refinery where he encounters his first monster. After it passes, he proceeds through a trap door into the cellar archives where he discovers that a water demon now inhabits the flooded area. After leaping from box to box in an effort to confuse the monster, he narrowly escapes through the door to the back hall where he is greeted with a calming fountain and a brightly lit room.</p><p>Daniel continues to follow his <a href=\"/flashback/3015-226\" data-ref-id=\"3015-226\">flashbacks</a> to an elevator lever that no longer functions. Upon learning this, Daniel explores Baron Alexander's study. Daniel makes a grizzly discovery upon arriving in the Baron's office. He has been attempting to harness some primal breed of energy from animals. In a note left on his desk, he explains that the energy is only released when the creature is about to experience death so being able to harness it with any sort of regularity will prove difficult.</p><p>The next stop is the guest bedroom where Daniel is quick to recall that he stayed here fairly recently. A journal page left here details an orb that he pulled out of a tomb on a recent excavation. The orb he explains contained a wondrous power but just as he felt it in his grasp, it shattered into pieces that he could not reassemble. Daniel then recalls that he left the key to the machine room behind a painting in his room. That in hand and a quick trip to a nearby storage room, he proceeds into the machine room to repair the elevator.</p><p>Another collection of Daniel's journal entries explains why he came to the castle in the first place. Apparently, he found himself haunted by horrid dreams after his incident with the orb. He requested the aid of three specialists as a means of getting to the source of his new affliction. Much to his dismay, all of the men ended up brutally murdered. Daniel then attempted to contact others who may know something more about the orb. He received varying responses but the urgency of the Baron's return letter piqued his interest. Baron Alexander requested that Daniel come to his castle right away before it is too late. Orb pieces in hand, he went straight to the Baron's castle.</p><figure style=\"width: 480px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1638152-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.00.15_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638152\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1638152-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.00.15_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638152\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57879/1638152-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.00.15_am.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57879/1638152-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.00.15_am.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The fountain in The Great Hall.</figcaption></figure><p>Once inside the elevator, it lowers him partway before malfunctioning and sending him into free fall. He crawls from the wreckage into a prison block that is shrouded in total darkness. A flashback explains that the Baron also carries the responsibility of a prison warden. After some careful traversing, he procures a hammer and chipper which he uses to widen a tunnel within a previous inmate's cell. Again more perilous trekking leads Daniel out of the prison and into the cistern. A flashback explains that the Baron uses this area as a secret underground passage. As is Daniel's luck, the route his former self used has been entirely blocked. This time a flood impedes his progress.</p><p>Daniel finds that the flood water can be drained from a nearby room. In this room he also finds a journal entry that details a warding ritual performed by the Baron. Daniel willingly had this ritual performed in an effort to slow the impeding doom of this shadow beast. The ritual involved killing a man the Baron claimed was a murderer.</p><p>Daniel then discovers that a poisonous fungi now inhabits the no longer flooded route into the sewer. He proceeds into the morgue which contains numerous bodies as one might expect. Daniel locates a note that details a toxin that wiped out most of Alexander's servants. The note goes on to explain that he has indeed developed an antidote that will surely stop the outbreak. Daniel observes that the Baron has made this antidote using the body of an infected servant. Daniel extracts the antidote and enters the sewers.</p><p>After evading yet more monsters in the sewers, Daniel arrives at the nave. This is a much more visibly depraved area of the Baron's castle as it functioned as an area for prisoner's who awaited torture. Upon entering the center of this area, Daniel is introduced to <a href=\"/heinrich-cornelius-agrippa/3005-19409\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19409\">Agrippa</a>, a shattered husk of a man who claims to be able to aid Daniel. He explains that Alexander has been using destroyed pieces of another orb in torture as they seem to produce intense anxiety in his victims. If Daniel can reunite those pieces, he may be able to stop Alexander from using the new restored orb that past Daniel had inadvertently handed him. Agrippa also requests that he create a tonic for him that would free him from the shattered husk he currently resides in.</p><p>Daniel then enters the various torture chambers in an effort to locate the old orb chunks. He also begins to suffer horrible flashbacks as he begins to realize what he has become. Daniel had been aiding the Baron in the torture of the countless innocents the Baron had delivered to his castle. He did so as the Baron claimed their suffering and sacrifice would surely slow the advancement of the shadow demon. As his grief overtakes him, Daniel recalls that the Baron and he raided a small farm home killing the husband and kidnapping the wife and her three daughters for sacrifices. A journal entry explains that Daniel no longer feels justified in the killing to keep back the beast. In this entry, he curses the Baron for making him do these horrid things and claims his revenge.</p><p>As Daniel returns to Agrippa to ask what he is to do next, he is swarmed by monsters who lock him in a nearby cell. Daniel's escape is quick but the Baron's voice fills his head taunting him. Suddenly, something terrible begins to chase Daniel. He narrowly escape back to the nave. Once there, he creates the tonic that supposedly will free Agrippa. Agrippa drinks it and requests that Daniel remove his head.</p><p>Daniel now enters the chancel to reunite the orb. A path opens leading to Alexander's hollowed inner sanctum. To enter the orb chamber where Alexander is surely awaiting Daniel makes a blood sacrifice and enters. A naked floating Baron greets Daniel there. He explains that he is hardly evil and that Daniel is to share blame in much of what has transpired. Alexander goes on to say that he is going to harness the power of the shadow which has grown tremendously with all the sacrifices to warp himself into another world. The three endings are as follows.</p><h3>Endings</h3><ul><li><b>Good Ending</b>: Daniel throws Agrippa's head into the newly opened portal. Daniel and the Baron are consumed by the shadow but Agrippa calls upon a man named Johann Weyer to free Daniel from the abyss.</li><li><b>Revenge Ending</b>: Daniel destroys the portal before it can open, and the shadow consumes the Baron but spares Daniel. Daniel leaves the castle with a guilt-free conscience.</li><li><b>Bad Ending</b>: The Baron escapes to the other world. The shadow consumes Daniel.</li></ul><h2>Development</h2><p>Amnesia: The Dark Descent started off a very different game than the final product; it contained a more traditional structure, with the main character running around several hub worlds that could be completed in any order, collecting money that he could then give to NPCs to help solve puzzles or advance the story. The story itself was very different as well; according to an early pitch document, it would involve the main character traveling to a Castle (much like Brennenberg) in order to prevent an evil \"Nobleman\" (much like Alexander) from orchestrating an unspecified evil plan. Killing enemies was originally a larger part of the game, even though the document states that \"combat is not a large part of the gameplay\"; the main character was to be given various weapons, including melee weapons and a bow &amp; arrow. The player could even trick monsters into walking into pools of <a href=\"/electrified-water/3015-8088\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8088\">electrified water</a> and other such environmental hazards.</p><p>While the game that Frictional originally had in mind was vastly different, there were some very distinct similarities. First there are \"Visions\", which were the predecessor of the flashbacks, and act as such. The puzzles, as outlined in the document, are identical to those found in the finished product: the team talks about balancing the slow, thinking puzzles against the \"action\" puzzles, such as when the player need to clear the debris during the encounter with the water monster. The interplay between light and darkness was still there, though it differed in the sense that light would restore strength, and that lighting a corridor would also make it <i>easier</i> to pass the monster. Also, they kept the diary entries, though they were written by other characters instead of the protagonist.</p><p>So, some things changed and others stayed the same. In the end, the team found restraint, choosing not to include the \"gamey-er\" elements and instead going for a so-called \"purer\" horror experience.</p><h2>Justine Expansion</h2><p>In conjunction with the <a href=\"/portal-2/3030-21662\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21662\">Portal 2</a> Potato Sack ARG, in which <a href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve</a> held a sale of 13 indie games on <a href=\"/steam/3015-718\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a> which were then subsequently 'invaded' by various forms of <a href=\"/glados/3005-722\" data-ref-id=\"3005-722\">GLaDOS</a>, Frictional Games released a short expansion to the main game, titled \"<a href=\"/justine-florebelle/3005-18629\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18629\">Justine</a>\". The expansion is more puzzle-oriented than the base game and features an omniscient narrator (not unlike <a href=\"/portal/3025-588\" data-ref-id=\"3025-588\">Portal</a>). It is loosely tied to the main game, with a collectible note from Daniel.</p><p>Players control an unnamed female protagonist who wakes up in a dungeon, at the bottom of a castle, with a monster at her doorstep. Like Daniel, she doesn't know who she is or why she's here, and so is led along by the voice of Justine, a twisted and mysterious woman, emitting from various phonographs around the dungeon. She has kidnapped three people who were important in her life, and she asks the player to spare them or kill them. The aforementioned monster comes in three forms (though they are the same visual model), each a different suitor for Justine. Players travel through the dungeon and slowly unravel who they are and who Justine is.</p><p>The game does not allow players to save, upon dying, players are taken back to the desktop. The developers have said that this is a deliberate choice made to \"ratchet up the tension\". The Justine expansion is currently unavailable if not bought through Steam, though Frictional has promised to bring it to other <a href=\"/digital-distribution/3015-2329\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2329\">digital distribution</a> services.</p><h2>Additional Information</h2><ul><li>According to the original pitch document, the game was at first called \"Unknown\".</li><li>Inside the game installation one can find a locked archive file called supersecret.rar. Inside the file one can find a variety of media which relate to the games development such as level progress flowcharts, concept art, early videos etc. The password to this file is <b>lke271tyr299odn314</b> and is obtained by piecing together the supplied string of characters found at the bottom of the screen in each of the 3 endings.</li><li>It is speculated that the passwords one receives at the end of the game represent the three Norse gods <a href=\"/loki/3005-1993\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1993\">Loki</a> (spelled \"Loke\" in Scandinavia), <a href=\"/tyr/3005-5443\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5443\">Tyr</a> and <a href=\"/odin/3005-1778\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1778\">Odin</a>, each shortened to three letters.</li><li>Much of the game is based on historical figures and organizations, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Cornelius_Agrippa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Weyer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johann Weyer</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Black_Eagle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Order of the Black Eagle</a>.</li><li>Brennenburg might be a reference to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brandenburg</a>, since they both translate from German to \"<i>Burning Castle</i>\" <i>\u2014</i> Brandenburg was considered the heart of Prussia, which is where the game takes place.</li><li>The screams of the monsters were made by combining a long metal pipe with a large metal funnel, and then moaning loudly into the end of the pipe.</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The <a href=\"/original-soundtrack-release/3015-189\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">original soundtrack</a> for Amnesia: the Dark Descent was composed by <a

The game revolves around the protagonist <a href=\"/klonoa/3005-685\" data-ref-id=\"3005-685\">Klonoa</a> and his sidekick <a href=\"/huepow/3005-1051\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1051\">Huepow</a>.

A remake of the game, simply titled <a href=\"/klonoa/3030-49398\" data-ref-id=\"3030-49398\">Klonoa </a>for the West, for <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> was released in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan </a>on December 4th 2008 and in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a> on May 5th 2009 and in <a href=\"/europe/3035-289\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe</a> on May 22nd of the same year.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Throughout the game you take control of Klonoa, a cat-like creature with wings as ears, and his trusty sidekick Huepow, a spirit enchanted inside of a ring. The gameplay in Klonoa is rather unique as the game is played in 2.5D, this means the majority of the game is a 2D sidescrolling platformer but at certain points the player will need to interact with objects outside of the 2D dimensions. Klonoa can fire Huepow from his ring to interact with objects and enemies. Once Klonoa has hit an enemy he can use it to double jump or fire it at another enemy causing them to collide and explode. Other core elements of the gameplay include running, jumping and solving puzzles to progress through the games next set of levels which are called Visions. The game consists of 6 Visions each with two sections in which the second section contains a Boss fight at the end. Bosses are an integral part of the gameplay in Klonoa, however they have been criticized for their difficulty.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/207239-picture_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207239\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74686192468619\" data-width=\"478\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 478px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/207239-picture_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207239\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1699/207239-picture_9.png\"/></a><figcaption>Klonoa's nightmare</figcaption></figure><p>The games plot starts in the Town of Breezegale which is fueled by its inhabitants dreams, though no one can clearly remember them.

One day Klonoa awakes to a find that an object has infact crashed into the mountain and he sets off with his best friend Huepow to find out what happened. When they reach the top of the mountain they find two strange men, Ghadius and Joka who are searching for a pendant with magical properties.

The villagers of Breezegale all resemble anthropomorphic rabbits, with long furry ears and catlike faces. As can be expected, it is the village that our hero Klonoa calls home. Among the many outstanding features of this town is the Bell of Wind, a giant golden bell placed at the top of the aptly named Bell Hill with the Moon Pendant of Lephise is hidden inside. Besides the Bell, another landmark of Breezegale is the gigantic Windmill near the town's center. This windmill is shown as being the source of the Wind Spirit's power during the second game cinematic. Last but not least, Balue's Tower is also located in Breezegale. Although construction on this tower was only beginning as the game started, by the end of the story it has been completed. Upon unlocking the Tower as a bonus level, it is revealed to be several stories high... one of the largest structures in all of Phantomile. The boss of this stage is the Rongo Lango, one of Joka's pets. When returning to a corrupted Breezgale later in the game, the boss you fight will be Baladium, a winged cobra with various unusual abilities.</p><h3>Forlock: The Tree Village</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/446257-picture_36.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-446257\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74213836477987\" data-width=\"477\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 477px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/446257-picture_36.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-446257\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1699/446257-picture_36.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1699/446257-picture_36.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The Cog</figcaption></figure><p>Forlock is the ancient wood village of Phantomile. The entire village consists solely of a colossal tree-house, the home of many jungle citizens. The most ancient and well-known citizen in all of Forlock is Granny, who knows large amounts of old legends, myths, and other forgotten stories. She lives at the very top of Forlock in a gigantic mansion of wooden machinery. Located on the very side of Granny's house is a huge cog, which if stops turning stops the flow of water to Jugpot. It is also interesting to note that the Wood Spirit of Phantomile gives its energy from this very contraption during the second game cinematic. The boss of this stage is Gelg Bolm, a bizarre bomb-like creature that is only defenseless to attacks from above.</p><h3>Jugpot: The Kingdom of Water</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/207235-picture_6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207235\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74423480083857\" data-width=\"477\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 477px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/207235-picture_6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207235\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1699/207235-picture_6.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1699/207235-picture_6.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Boss fight against Pamela</figcaption></figure><p>Jugpot is the large Phantomilian kingdom of Water that connects directly to Forlock. In the very center of Jugpot is a giant seashell with a cog in the center. Besides holding the power of Phantomile's Water Spirit, this structure is also the source of all water for the three Kingdoms and the Castle of King Seadoph himself. He rules alongside his \"servant\" Pamela: a fishlike creature with the ability to fly. Pamela has a son named Karal who befriends Klonoa during the game's story. During the story Ghadius possesses both Seadoph and Pamela in an attempt to destroy Jugpot. It is only due to Karal's help that Klonoa meets and confronts the distressed King, ultimately freeing him from the Ghadius' powers. Once freed, Seadoph directs our two heroes to Forlock, the Tree Village in order to stop Ghadius. The boss of this stage is Pamela. She can only be defeated by throwing Seadoph at her.</p><h3>Coronia: The Temple of the Sun</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/447068-picture_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-447068\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74213836477987\" data-width=\"477\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 477px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/447068-picture_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-447068\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1699/447068-picture_9.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1699/447068-picture_9.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Joka</figcaption></figure><p>Coronia, the Temple of the Sun, is a floating Kingdom located high above Phantomile. Klonoa and Huepow are brought to there after defeating Gelg Bolm in the Forlock. The only inhabitants of Coronia that the player meets are the priests Solare, Soleil and Coronia's High Priest Moire. These three are dedicated to guarding their Kingdom at all costs. At the very top of Coronia floats some sort of circular altar. It is at this very place that Klonoa must defeat Ghadius' servant, Joka. Unlike the past three Kingdoms, Coronia does not seem to have a related Spirit. Instead, this Temple appears to be the key which summons the ancient Moon Kingdom of Cress. How exactly this was achieved is unclear, but seems to be related to the large blue Crystal at the arena's center. Once Joka has been defeated, it explodes in a burst of energy, triggering the similar reactions of the other Three Kingdoms.

Jet Grind Radio was the first video game to feature this cartoon-like graphical style. Jet Grind Radio was released o the Sega Dreamcast in Japan on June 29, 2000, and was released on November 1 in the United States. The game did not sell well in the United States, but was critically acclaimed and gained a cult following. The sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, was released on February 25, 2002 for the Xbox. The game once again met with poor sales but critical acclaim. In 2003, a port of the original Jet Grind Radio was released on the Game Boy Advance. At Comic-Con 2008, rumors surfaced of a new Jet Grind Radio for the Wii. However, the rumors were silenced when comic book artist Cory \"Rey\" Lewis announced that Jet Grind Radio was proposed to Sega by Kuju Entertainment, though Sega turned them down. Lewis had created concept art for the proposed title.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The basic concept of Jet Grind Radio is simple. Each level has a time limit, a life meter and spots which you need to tag. The player must spray graffiti on designated locations. However, while the player tries to do this, the player will be met with resistance from law enforcement, at first just police officers with nightsticks but eventually helicopters with heat seeking missiles. There is also rival gangs to worry about as well.</p><h3>Jet Set Radio</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699152\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.69375\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699152\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5709/699152-143957_full.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Jet Set Radio.</figcaption></figure><p>In this game, the player is given a set amount of time in which they must tag a number of designated spotsl. A trick system is featured - if the player jumps with enough speed, or lands on a grindable rail, a trick is automatically activated. The player may also to skate backwards by flicking the analog stick up and down. The tagging system is based around quick time events triggered when the player activates a tag location. When they do so, a quick time event occurs - the quick time consist of rotating the analog stick in certain directions that the game tells the player.</p><h3>Jet Set Radio Future</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421703\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421703\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4356/421703-pic_jsrf_008.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Jet Set Radio Future.</figcaption></figure><p>The second game features a number of improvements from its predecessor. The game features an improved trick system. Tricks are activated by pressing the X button while grinding at a certain pace, and the way skating backwards is done is by pressing the Y button instead of flicking the analog stick up and down. The quick time tagging is removed - the player only has to activate a location to spray their tag. The timer from the original game is also removed. The player gains the ability to boost through the usage of 10 paint cans.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The story of the Jet Set Radio series is about of group of <i>\"Rudies,\"</i> who are also graffiti artists. They skate around the city of Tokyo-to, tagging their art work as a means of expressing themselves. The story centers around a gang that is known as the GGs. The leader of the gang in the original story is Beat, and in the second game is Corn (Known as Tab in the original). At first they go around and tag their art work while battling rival gangs like the Love Shockers, Poison Jam, and Noise Tank while trying not to get hunted down by the police. The ploat thickens when they find a mysterious record that can summon an ancient demon. A corporation known as the Rokkaku group are hunting for the record, and are kidnapping members of rival street gangs in an effort to discover this record.</p><p>The Story of the second game is basically a retelling of the story of Jet Set Radio. It's partly due to the fact that the developers of the game have stated that it's a re imagining and not a true sequel). Certain points of the story is told a bit differently - the game takes place in the future, more rival gangs are introduced in the story, and the Japanese police is led by different characters.</p><h2>Jet Set Radio Re-Releases and Future Sequels</h2><p>On July 24th, 2008, Sega filed a trademark for their Jet Grind Radio series, separate from the Dreamcast trademark. This, coupled with rumblings from \"industry-insiders\" in Comic-Con, opened speculation for a Wii sequel to the game. A post by Corey Lewis indicated that there was a pitch made to Sega from developer Kuju - now known as Headstrong Games - that was turned down by Sega.</p><p>Jet Set Radio was re-released for a number of digital platforms in 2012. Including consoles, handhelds and mobile devices. The hint for it's re-release first surfaced in a Kotaku article posted on April 25, 2010. The article showed a photo of a game called <i>\"Jet Set Radio\"</i> sitting in someone's game library on an <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20\" slug=\"xbox-360\">Xbox 360</a> dashboard.</p>"}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Jet Set Radio"}

With the game removing the individual screens which was the format of the original game, some puzzles have changed and this has meant that some levels and puzzles have been reworked to fit in better with the new structure. The game also introduces new mechanics which were previously not available during Abe's Oddysee, although used in it's sequels, including a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/quicksaving/3015-2127\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2127\">quick save</a> feature and improved gamespeak. Improved gamespeak allows the player to talk to more than one Mudokon at once, which also changes some of the puzzles, making them far easier than before. Because of this, some puzzles have been slightly reworked as to balance this feature, as in Abe's Oddysee, Abe could only have the attention of one Mudokon at a time.</p><p>The <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> version of the game was originally released on July 22, 2014. The <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, <a href=\"/mac/3045-17\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a>, and <a href=\"/linux/3045-152\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> versions of the game are set to be released on February 25, 2015. The <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> versions of the game are slated for release sometime in March of 2015. The Wii U version of the game was initially developed internally and then later handed off to port house Olde Sk\u00fc\u00fcl. It's set for a Fall 2015 release.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The game takes place in the continent of Mudos, in the land of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/oddworld/3035-288\" data-ref-id=\"3035-288\">Oddworld</a>. Home to <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/mudokons/3015-1122\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1122\">Mudokons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/glukkon/3015-1567\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1567\">Glukkons</a> and various wildlife such as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/scrab/3015-1322\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1322\">Scrabs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/paramite/3015-1573\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1573\">Paramites</a> and the now extinct Meeches, in it lies the biggest meat processing plant in Oddworld: <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/rupturefarms/3035-802\" data-ref-id=\"3035-802\">Rupturefarms</a>. Administrated by the high ranking Glukkon of the Magog Cartel, known as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/molluck-the-glukkon/3005-3805\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3805\">Molluck</a>, he was faced with a huge dilemma, with profits beginning to fall and the future of Rupturefarms was looking grim. The creatures of Oddworld were running scarce, thanks to the extinction of Meeches and the high in-take of Scrabs and Paramites. Molluck had to come up with a new and daring plan, to help save the future of Rupturefarms. A new kind of meat that would boost sales and create a profit once again. A meat made from their very own 'employees', the Mudokons called Mudokon Pops.</p><p>We follow the story of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/abe/3005-729\" data-ref-id=\"3005-729\">Abe</a>, a slave of Rupturefarms who is working late one night. Spotting a light through a gap, he sneaks over and listens into board meeting with the Glukkons and overhears Molluck's bold new plan. With a screen showcasing the falling profits, Molluck is confident and reveals their new product to the other Glukkons. Upon the discovery of what New 'N' Tasty really is, Abe flees the scene and is spotted by a camera, which causes <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/slig/3015-644\" data-ref-id=\"3015-644\">Sligs</a> to take chase. Abe must escape and save as many of his other 299 fellow employees in the process, whilst utilizing his power to possess Sligs and guide other Mudokons to safety.</p><p>After escaping RuptureFarms and unaware that he has a destiny, Abe spots a moon in the sky with the paw of his people. Being enchanted by the moon, Abe slips off of a cliff and hits his head. Whilst knocked out, he is confronted by the mysterious tribesman wearing a large mask, known as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/big-face/3005-14569\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14569\">Big Face</a>. Big Face shows Abe a vision and explains that he must save the remaining workers at RuptureFarms in order to restore the lost land. To do so, he must complete a number of trials in the dark forests of Paramonia and the scorching hot deserts of Scrabania. Upon completed the trials, Big Face bestows a scar on each of Abe's hands, resembling a Paramite and a Scrab. Combined, they allow one to become the mighty and powerful demi-God, known as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/shrykull/3005-5347\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5347\">Shrykull</a>. Once in possession of this power, Abe can return to RuptureFarms and rescue his remaining friends until finally shutting the factory down for good!</p><p>After shutting down all the power, Abe finds himself caught in the board room, where he is knocked out and captured. Taken away by Sligs, he is tied up above a meat grinder, preventing him from chanting and bestowing the power of Shrykull or possessing any Sligs. Meanwhile, Big Face and the freed Mukokons discuss Abe's actions and whether or not he should be saved. It is at this point the game splits into two different endings. Abe's life, in the hands of the Mudokons is determined by how many are saved during the game. Whether or not he lives, is down to them...</p><p>Should Abe save enough Mudokons for them to even consider saving him, they combine their power, causing electricity to form from the sky, striking Molluck and his loyal Slig, either killing them or incapacitating them. With both of them down, Big Face appears and teleports Abe to a ceremony, celebrating his success, where all 99 Mudokons are cheering his name.</p><p>If Abe does not save enough of the Mudokons, he is ultimately left behind by the few who made it back safely. Disgusted with his behaviour, they refuse to help Big Face and leave Abe for dead. Molluck then gives the order for his execution and a Slig pulls a lever, releasing Abe into the meat grinder, killing him.</p>", "deck": "Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New 'n' Tasty is a remake of the original Oddworld game, Abe's Oddysee.", "aliases": "Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New n' Tasty\r\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee New 'n Tasty\r\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee New and Tasty\r\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee HD", "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/14876/2644182-new_n_tasty_official_cover_art.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/oddworld-abes-oddysee-new-n-tasty/3030-39928/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39928/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": "2014-07-22 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/", "id": 1, "name": "ESRB: T"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/", "id": 36, "name": "PEGI: 12+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/", "id": 38, "name": "OFLC: PG"}], "date_added": "2012-10-06 13:06:52", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/", "abbreviation": "PS3N", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/", "id": 88, "name": "PlayStation Network (PS3)"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WIIU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/", "abbreviation": "PSNV", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/", "id": 143, "name": "PlayStation Network (Vita)"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/", "abbreviation": "XONE", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/", "id": 145, "name": "Xbox One"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/", "abbreviation": "PS4", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/", "id": 146, "name": "PlayStation 4"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/", "abbreviation": "LIN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/", "id": 152, "name": "Linux"}], "id": 39928, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New 'n' Tasty!"}, "platform": "PS4", "title": "Oddworld Abe's Oddysee: New'n' Tasty"}

In the beginning of the game, Stranger captures numerous criminals to pay for a mysterious operation. As Stranger returns the criminals for their retrospective bounties, Stranger hears of a town of creatures called Grubbs. The Grubbs have been besieged by a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-557\" href=\"/demons/3015-557\">demonic</a> creature, and his army of minions. The Grubbs were once protected by a race called the Steef, now extinct, leaving them unprotected.</p><p>As Stranger continues to collect bounties, he finds that a man named Sekto has been drying up a river in the Grubbs town. When Stranger confronts him, Sekto offers him a bounty for the remaining Steef that he believes that are still around. The Stranger refuses this offer, leaving Sekto upset. Sekto hires a criminal, D.

Regardless of the creatures threats, the duo proceed on. The players soon come across a mansion where they meet Charles Vincent, an older vampire hunter who has also set sail to destroy the lord of darkness. Carrie and Reinhardt also stumble into Rosa, a young girl that is also a vampire. After meeting either of these characters, players discover the route to Dracula's castle, but they must first go through the terrace, a maze, and then the underground area and catacombs to reach the castle itself. Players meet the game's item seller, and everyone's favorite demon merchant, Renon. Renon is used to buy recovery items, more sub weapons and also gives info, since he's on nobody's side, but money. As the young hunters make way into the garden maze, they are met by a Frankenstein look-a-like wielding a chainsaw, who is also chasing a little kid.

In Reinhardt Schnieder's ending, he's thinks by killing Vincent and the aristocratic vampire, that he's killed Count Dracula, still unaware that Malus is the lord of Darkness. He and Malus ride off into the sunset. In carries ending, she is taken by Malus or Count Dracula and forced to marry him and therefore is condemned to a life of agony. The Good endings play out if you beat the game in fifteen in game days or less, and they are; The hero reaches the castle before Vincent and defeats the aristocratic Vampire. Then, Malus appears as an adult possessed by a demon and attacks. You must then defeat him.

It is the first game to take place in the 21st century and the first game to <em>not</em> take place in Europe. It is also the first game to abandon the traditional sub-weapon system for a unique \"Tactical Soul\" system, where the player character can absorb (at random) the <a href=\"/souls/3015-1449\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1449\">souls</a> of fallen enemies to use in both combat and utility.</p><p>The story takes place in the year 2035, 36 years after the final defeat of <a href=\"/dracula/3005-348\" data-ref-id=\"3005-348\">Count Dracula</a>. The main protagonist is <a href=\"/soma-cruz/3005-1537\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1537\">Soma Cruz</a>, a seemingly-normal 18-year-old student who visits <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> as a transfer student. While visiting the Hakuba shrine to witness a solar eclipse with his childhood friend <a href=\"/mina-hakuba/3005-8681\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8681\">Mina Hakuba</a>, both Soma and Mina are drawn into a mysterious castle inside the eclipse, where they learn from <a href=\"/alucard/3005-646\" data-ref-id=\"3005-646\">Genya Arikado</a>, a member of a mysterious Japanese organization, that they are in Dracula's castle. Players control Soma as he explores the castle, unlocking new abilities while unsheathing a prophecy about the reincarnation of Dracula.</p><p>The game received a sequel in 2005 for the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>, dubbed <a href=\"/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow/3030-11321\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11321\">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a>, which abandons the dark, gothic, painting-like art style for an anime-inspired look.

The game incorporates a number of elements from console RPG games, such as the experience and levelling up systems. Soma, the main character, will gain experience points whenever he defeats an enemy. Once enough experience has been gained he will level up, increasing all of his stats, and improving his performance in combat. In addition, the game borrows inventory and loot systems from RPGs that allow Soma to collect upgrades for armor and weapons. Equippable items, along with hearts and money, are dropped by enemies, and can be found when destroying breakable light sources. </p><p>Being a post-Symphony of the Night Castlevania title, the game is non-linear in nature. Soma will explore the many quadrants of Dracula's castle, discovering new powers, secret passage, and solving puzzles to advance. He will need to search thoroughly, backtrack, and experiment in order to progress through the castle, and reach new areas. Each area houses different scenery, tougher enemies, and new puzzles and challenges for Soma to tackle.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7539/501350-castlevania___aria_of_sorrow___gba_45.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-501350\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7539/501350-castlevania___aria_of_sorrow___gba_45.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-501350\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7539/501350-castlevania___aria_of_sorrow___gba_45.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7539/501350-castlevania___aria_of_sorrow___gba_45.png\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Unique to Aria of Sorrow is the tactical soul system, which allows Soma to absorb the souls of his enemies, granting him an expanded repertoire of special abilities. These souls are divided into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. Soma can equip one of each at any given point in the game. Bullet souls are generally offensive in nature, and will usually create a projectile attack. Guardian souls have an effect over time, and include summons and transformations. Enchant souls are continuously active when equipped, and will increase Soma's statistics, or grant him a number of abilities. Finally, the ability souls will give Soma additional skills, usually required for progress through the castle. Both bullet and guardian souls require magic points to use, while Enchant and ability souls do not.</p>", "deck": "Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow is the third Castlevania installment for the Game Boy Advance, bringing the tale of Castlevania to the 21st century and putting players in the shoes of Soma Cruz, a seemingly-normal guy who has the power to absorb souls of the castle's demons and equip them.", "aliases": "Castlevania: Minuet of Dawn\nCastlevania: Akatsuki no Menuett", "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2582052-box_cvaos.png", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2582052-box_cvaos.png", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2582052-box_cvaos.png", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2582052-box_cvaos.png", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2582052-box_cvaos.png", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2582052-box_cvaos.png", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2582052-box_cvaos.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow/3030-12036/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-12036/", "number_of_user_reviews": 2, "original_release_date": "2003-05-06 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/", "id": 1, "name": "ESRB: T"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/", "id": 25, "name": "CERO: A"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-31/", "id": 31, "name": "OFLC: M"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:02:14", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-4/", "abbreviation": "GBA", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4/", "id": 4, "name": "Game Boy Advance"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WIIU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}], "id": 12036, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow"}, "platform": "GBA", "title": "Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow"}

Each soul sports a unique power, and there are four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant and Ability. Players can absorb a soul as much they want to except for the Ability souls that are unlocked through specific boss battles and plot points. Each specific soul has a different rarity; the better ones, like the Valkyrie soul, are much harder to get than an ordinary Zombie soul. At <a href=\"/yoko-belnades/3005-8680\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8680\">Yoko Belnades</a>' shop, you can use absorbed souls to make higher-powered weapons with the penultimate versions requiring the rarest ones to find. If two people have a cartridge for Dawn of Sorrow, an option to trade souls through wireless connectivity became available. Souls relating to the storyline or souls that allow access to later parts of the game are not available through trade.</p><h4>Magic Seal</h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Magic Seal mechanic first appeared in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow with no appearances in the Castlevania series since then. During large boss battles, players received a prompt to draw a predetermined symbol to finish the boss off; there were no other options when defeating bosses. The further into the game the player got, the more elaborate the symbols became.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Reception concerning the Magic Seal mechanic was generally negative and deemed as \"unnecessary\" or \"pace-breaking\" according to many players and reputable reviewers. This is Dawn of Sorrow's only use of the touch screen other than breaking crystal blocks or controlling familiars. The series has since abandoned extensive use of touch screen capabilities due to negative criticisms.</p><h2>Bosses &amp; Alternate Endings</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are 16 boss fights in the game:</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/210719-dawnofsorrow6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-210719\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.744140625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3693/210719-dawnofsorrow6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-210719\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3693/210719-dawnofsorrow6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3693/210719-dawnofsorrow6.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Boss fights are as gruesome as ever</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Flying Armor</li><li>Balore</li><li>Dmitrii</li><li>Malphas</li><li>Dario</li><li>Puppet Master</li><li>Gergoth</li><li>Zephyr</li><li>Rahab</li><li>Bat Company</li><li>Paranoia</li><li>Dario (again)</li><li>Aguni</li><li>Death</li><li>Abaddon</li><li>Menace</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Some boss fights are optional as the game can be completed at three different points during the main story progression.

The goal is to cut past all enemies on every screen and get to the end as soon as possible with the hero you have in adventure mode. Players can also challenge a friend to fight past their custom dungeons.</p><h4>Boss Rush Mode</h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In this mode you have to defeat all of the game's bosses in order. You are given a Super Potion, a Mana Prism and a Rusty Food Tin. The objective is to defeat the bosses as fast as possible. Depending on how fast you defeat them, you are given different prizes at the end.</p><h4>Julius Mode</h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In Julius mode you start off as Julius Belmont, and are later joined by Yoko Belnades and Alucard. You are able to swap between the three characters by pressing the X-button. You fight through the castle as in Normal Mode, except with a different story and a different final boss.

Players guide Richter through seven stages, increasing their score by defeating enemies and collecting bags of money (dropped by enemies or destroying scenery). Players will also find <a href=\"/heart/3055-142\" data-ref-id=\"3055-142\">heart</a>-shaped <a href=\"/jewel/3055-1737\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1737\">jewels</a>, which serve as ammunition for Richter's sub-weapons and super attacks (known as \"Item Crashes\"). Unlike <a href=\"/super-castlevania-iv/3030-11443\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11443\">Super Castlevania IV</a>, released four years earlier, the player cannot do any special tricks with his <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3055-284\" data-ref-id=\"3055-284\">Vampire Killer</a> whip (such as whip in eight directions, hold out the whip freely to block projectiles, and use the whip to grapple onto special points). However, Richter can perform a backflip dodge (by double-tapping the jump button). Richter can also maintain his position while getting hit simply by crouching (preventing him from being knocked back), and can jump on and off stairs (by holding up or down on the d-pad and pressing the jump button).</p><p>Other than jewels and bags of money, players can also find pendants (which clears the screen of all enemies), transparency <a href=\"/potion/3055-79\" data-ref-id=\"3055-79\">elixirs</a> (which grant Richter <a href=\"/temporary-invincibility/3015-266\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporary invulnerability</a>), and food (which restores some of Richter's <a href=\"/health/3015-130\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health</a>). Defeating a boss causes a Mystic Sphere to drop from the sky, refilling Richter's health completely and clearing the stage. Players earn extra lives by finding 1-Up items scattered throughout the game and clearing stages without getting hit, as well as for every time the player earns 20,000 points.</p><h3>Sub-Weapons/Item Crashes</h3><p>Along the way, Richter can pick up unique sub-weapons that consume the jewel meter for a special attack (performed by holding up on the directional pad and pressing the attack button). Richter can also perform \"Item Crushes\", which sacrifice more jewels for a super attack (by pressing the special Item Crush button). All of the sub-weapons and Item Crushes perform like they did in <a href=\"/akumajo-dracula-x-chi-no-rondo/3030-12673\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12673\">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</a>.

On an emergency order from the Galactic Federation, bounty hunter <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\"> Samus Aran</a> travels to the planet Zebes in order to infiltrate a lair of space pirates, exterminate the metroids that they have in their possession, and destroy the space pirates' bio-mechanical computer, Mother Brain. The bosses Ridley and <a href=\"/kraid/3005-3010\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3010\"> Kraid</a> also return and are given appearances more in line with their redesigned forms that appeared in <a href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\"> Super Metroid</a>.</p><p>The plot is further expanded by cutscenes at key points to illustrate the story in more detail. It also works in key points of Samus's backstory that had been established in later games, depicting moments of her childhood as an orphan on Zebes, raised by the Chozo that once inhabited the planet. The biggest deviation from the original Metroid comes at the point where the first game ended. in Zero Mission, after Samus defeats Mother Brain and escapes to her ship, she is attacked by space pirates and forced to crash land, losing her power suit in the process. Armed with only an emergency pistol, she must sneak into the inner-most chamber of an old Chozo temple and complete a trial to acquire a newer, more powerful suit. Once done, she confronts a now cybernetic Ridley and uses a spare space pirate craft to escape.</p><h2>Gameplay </h2><p>Metroid Zero Mission controls similarly to Metroid Fusion. Players fire with B and jump with A. Zero Mission brings in power ups made famous by Super Metroid for this remake for a different take on the first game. Some effects also happen automatically such as the Speed Booster which turns off after walking for a while without getting obstructed. Players also have more control over some more advanced techniques in this game such as the Shinespark, which can now be cancelled by inclines while still allowing it to continue for a short while. An addition was made to the Shinespark, as it can now be used in Morph Ball mode, a technique which is necessary to get 100% of all items in the game. </p><p>Sequence Breaking was a big part in the design of Metroid Zero Mission. Some paths that exist in the game are solely there for the purpose of sequence breaking, and are otherwise unreachable without using techniques such as wall jumping, shinesparking or diagonal bomb jumping; all of which are techniques non-existent in the original Metroid. </p><p>After defeating Mother Brain and escaping Zebes, Samus is attacked by Space Pirates, leaving her marooned on Zebes without her Power Suit. This new part of the game which puts Samus in her Zero Suit, introduced first in this game. Samus is very weak in this segment, and only a few hits will result in a Game Over. Samus cannot kill enemies in this section, only stun them. This section of the game is a side-scrolling stealth segment which leads Samus getting the Gravity Suit as well as all the Unknown items she has picked up thus far. This will eventually lead to the final boss of the game as well as final escape sequence.</p><h2>Beam Upgrades</h2><h3>Long Beam</h3><p>An extension of Samus' Power Beam, allowing her to shoot farther to reach those annoying enemies at the corners of the screen and blow up all the rocks blocking Morph Ball tunnels.</p><h3>Charge Beam</h3><p>A fully charged blast has the same power as a missile, but it doesn't open red doors. Also if Samus somersaults into small enemies while holding a charge she will destroy them; a less powerful Screw Attack.</p><h3>Wave Beam</h3><p>The Wave Beam increases Samus's beam width and allows her to shoot through walls. It can also reveal destructible blocks.</p><h3>Ice Beam</h3><p>One shot of Ice Beam freezes some enemies in their tracks for a short period of time, making them easier to avoid. Since frozen enemies don't harm Samus, they can be used as platforms.</p><h3>Plasma Beam</h3><p>One of the unknown items Samus can collect early on which later becomes the Plasma Beam once Samus has fully upgraded her suit. Rather than stopping with one enemy Plasma Beam allows Samus's beam to keep flying to hit multiple enemies.</p><h2>Bomb Upgrades</h2><h3>Morph Ball Bomb</h3><p>Finally Samus's Morph Ball is no longer weak and defenseless. Morph Ball Bombs are used for opening new paths and she can use them to preform a bomb jump. Using Bombs on certain areas will reveal special blocks that require certain items to get past, such as Power Bombs and Missiles.</p><h3>Power Bomb</h3><p>This is the game's final upgrade. This bomb has a radius of about a screen and a half and destroys anything in its way.</p><h2>Missile Upgrades</h2><h3>Missile Tank</h3><p>A missile is more powerful than Samus's beam and can open red hatches, making it a great addition to her arsenal. In easy and normal difficulties the missile tank gives Samus five missiles, but on hard difficulty it gives her only two.</p><h3>Super Missile Tank</h3><p>A Super Missile is around five missiles combined into one huge explosion that opens green hatches and brings bosses to their knees. On easy and normal difficulty, the tank gives Samus two Super Missiles, where as it gives her one on hard difficulty.</p><h2>Suit Upgrades</h2><h3>Varia Suit</h3><p>The Varia Suit allows Samus to enter hot rooms that originally drained her health. She can even go in acid without fear of damage, but lava still zaps her health. Without a better suit upgrade, she will move at half speed while in these areas.</p><h3>Gravity Suit</h3><p>Another one of the unknown items; the Gravity Suit allows Samus to jump normally in acid, lava, or water and prevents damage from lava. The Gravity Suit also allows her to move freely in these areas without being slowed down.</p><h2>Miscellaneous Upgrades</h2><h3>Morph Ball</h3><p>Samus's first upgrade she get immediately after starting. Morph Ball allows her to enter small passages and evade enemies quicker.</p><h3>Power Grip</h3><p>Power Grip allows Samus to grab onto edges that she couldn't jump onto before. She can also fire her beam in five directions while hanging.</p><h3>High Jump</h3><p>This greatly increases how high Samus can jump, and even adds a jump to the Morph Ball. Using this allows her to reach areas that were once unreachable through jumping normally.</p><h3>Space Jump</h3><p>This allows Samus to continuously jump while in mid-air. When Samus acquires the Screw Attack, she can jump without fear of taking damage from enemies, which would cause her to lose her jump otherwise.</p><h3>Speed Booster</h3><p>This upgrade allows Samus to run faster through long corridors, destroying everything in her way, including blocks with an arrow on them. While activated, pressing down on the D-pad will allow her to perform the Shinespark technique which can be done by jumping twice and pressing a direction.</p><h3>Screw Attack</h3><p>This upgrade turns Samus's somersault into an upgrade that allows her to plow through all enemies (except for bosses), and destroys certain blocks by jumping into them.</p><h3>Energy Tanks</h3><p>These increase Samus's Health by 100 on every difficulty besides Hard. On Hard difficulty, Energy Tanks only increase her health by 50. </p><h2>Areas on Zebes</h2><p>Metroid Zero Mission takes all of the areas from the original Metroid and adds a couple of its' own. </p><h3>Brinstar </h3><p>This is the starting area of the game. Samus even starts in the exact same location as well. Most of the environments are rock and plant based. Here, she can obtain the Morph Ball, the Long Beam, the Varia Suit, Bombs and the Charge Beam; not necessarily in that order. She can also reach the areas Norfair, Tourian, Kraid and Crateria. Brinstar is basically the game's hub world since it connects to almost every other area in the game. </p><h3>Norfair </h3><p>The environment here is made up mostly of rocks and lava/acid. Some areas are not accessible if Samus do not have the Varia Suit due to the extreme temperatures, which will cause her to constantly take damage until she dies. In this area she can get the Ice Beam, the High Jump, the Wave Beam and the Speed Attack. In Norfair, she can access the areas Brinstar, Crateria, and Ridley. She can also access Kraid, but only through sequence breaking.</p><h3>Kraid </h3><p>This area is where Samus faces the first boss of the game, Kraid. Kraid is a giant lizard that is 2 screens tall. By defeating Kraid she obtains access to the Speed Booster. In Kraid, she can also get one of three unknown items, which are unlocked later in the game. Kraid, like Ridley is an area that existed in the original Metroid dedicated to confronting one of the game's main bosses. In Kraid, she can access Brinstar as well as Norfair, but the latter can only be reached through sequence breaking from this area.</p><h3>Ridley </h3><p>This area is where Samus faces the second boss of the game, Ridley. The area has a similar environmental breakdown as Norfair. Ridley is a giant, flying fire breathing dragon monster. By defeating Ridley, Samus obtains another unknown item. Along with Kraid, by defeating Ridley Samus opens up one of two paths that are required to be opened to reach the final area of the game, Tourian. </p><h3>Tourian </h3><p>This is the final area of the game, or at least the original game, and is only accessible through Brinstar. The area is very mechanical, but also contains lava. This area also introduces the player to Metroids, biological lifeforms that suck Samus's energy away at the slightest touch. They're also hard to shake off. At the end of Tourian, Samus will face Mother Brain. Mother Brain is somewhat different from the original Metroid in that it actually attacks Samus directly. After defeating Mother Brain, the game's first escape sequence, while similar to the original game takes Samus to Crateria and Samus' Ship, both of which were unseen in the first game. </p><h3>Crateria </h3><p>This new area of Zebes contains Samus' Ship as well as access to Tourian, Brinstar, Norfair and Chozodia. Samus can get the Power Grip early on in the game here. Samus will rarely visit Crateria throughout the game. Crateria is on the surface of Zebes, so it has no hazards outside of enemies. </p><h3>Chozodia and Pirate's Ship</h3><p>While Samus can access this area somewhat early on in the game, it is dominantly the final area of the game, containing the real final boss of the game. Here Samus can access Crateria, which is a short distance away from the other main areas of the game and she can get the Gravity Suit, and in turn unlock the 3 unknown items she has obtained throughout the game.

href=\"/hitbox-team/3010-7831\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7831\">Hitbox Team</a> depicting the adventures of a team of ninja janitors known as Dustforce. Rather than collect coins or destroy enemies, characters dust and sweep the environments, which are full of dirt, leaves, and other debris. Characters are able to double jump, wall run, and perform combos in their quest for clean.</p><p>A demo was released on August 1, 2010 for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>. It includes a tutorial, two maps, and a level editor, allowing players to create their own maps.</p><p>On 24 October, 2014 Dustforce DX was released as a free update for the game. This update included 16 new easy levels, remade tutorial, a redesigned hub to smooth the progression and 109 community-made levels.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97921/2108991-dustforce_judgement.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2108991\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3033932135729\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97921/2108991-dustforce_judgement.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2108991\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97921/2108991-dustforce_judgement.png\"/></a></figure><p>The main gameplay in Dustforce consists of navigating <a href=\"/super-meat-boy/3030-25114\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25114\">Super Meat Boy</a>-esque levels while avoiding hazards and cleaning debris off of the environment either by running over a dirty area or using attacks to knock the offending detritus off of wild animals; being covered in garbage has made the animals scared and hostile, and will attack Dustforce members until they are cleaned off.</p><p>Cleaning the level fills up a meter which, when full, lets players use a <a href=\"/full-screen-attack/3015-4886\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4886\">full-screen attack</a> that defeats all of the currently visible enemies. This is generally useful for large clusters of entities that require cleaning, but it resets the mid-air jumps so it be used to cross very wide gaps.</p><p>Upon completion of a stage, the player is given a rank in both Completion and Finesse. Completion measures the percentage of refuse cleaned in a level. Finesse reflects how high of a combo players are able to maintain. If both of these conditions are <a href=\"../../s-rank/92-2962/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S-Ranked</a>, the player is awarded with a key to unlock additional levels. Unfortunately, this means that levels must be perfected before the player can advance beyond a certain point.</p><p>Cleaning all of the debris in the level is usually as simple as working out the most fluid path to hit all of the dirty surfaces. Getting an S-Rank in Finesse means that the player must build up their combo by cleaning things with a less than five-second gap between, otherwise the combo resets to zero. A perfect run involves clearing all of a level's debris and defeating all the enemies while maintaining a single combo.</p><h2>Members of Dustforce</h2><ul><li><b>Dustman</b> (Blue): Wields a broom. The most balanced character.</li><li><b>Dustgirl</b> (Red): Wields a pushbroom. Has the biggest attack range but is the slowest character.</li><li><b>Dustkid</b> (Purple): Dual-wields <a href=\"/pom-poms/3055-1751\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1751\">pom-pom</a> dusters. Fastest and can triple jump but has a very small attack range and her jumps are quite low.</li><li><b>Dustworth</b> (Green): Wields a power vacuum cleaner. Has the highest jump and the furthest glide.</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>The game features a local-only multiplayer component. Up to 8 players containing teams of 4 can play (4v4). One team takes on the role of cleaning a stage as members of the Dustforce while the other team leaves dust everywhere they go and are tasked with making the stage as dirty as possible.</p><h2>Level Editor</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/69612/2436052-dustforce_leveleditor.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2436052\" data-ratio=\"0.57272727272727\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/69612/2436052-dustforce_leveleditor.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2436052\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/69612/2436052-dustforce_leveleditor.png\"/></a></figure><p>The level editor was released on May 1, 2012 as part of a large update which also brought the game to the Mac. Created levels can be uploaded and shared on Atlas, the official Dustforce level sharing community.</p><h2>Leaderboards</h2><p>There is an in game list of fastest runs for each stage sorted by rank and clear time.

Navigation of these obstacles requires extremely precise timing to pass. Failure means instant death and a quick restart from the beginning of the level. The player is given an infinite amount of lives and near-instantaneous respawns, but Meat Boy leaves a trail of blood to mark where he has been and what obstacles previously killed him. When a regular level is completed, a <a href=\"/instant-replay/3015-45\" data-ref-id=\"3015-45\">replay</a> showcases every attempt within the level simultaneously.</p><p>Characters have two abilities at their disposal: a <a href=\"/jump/3015-379\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jump</a> button and an ability button. For Meat Boy (and most other characters), pressing the ability button engages sprinting. Some characters sprint automatically and replace the ability button with another power, such as <a href=\"/tim/3005-5730\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5730\">Tim's</a> ability to rewind time or <a href=\"/viridian/3005-16930\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16930\">Viridian's</a> ability to inverse his own personal gravity. To keep the difficulty in check, the game features extremely precise controls. Quickly tapping the jump button performs a small hop, while holding down the jump button performs a tall leap. Players can also stick to the wall (which may either slow their descent or slightly continue their ascent) and press the jump button again for a <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall jump</a>. Some unlockable characters have special jumping abilities, such as <a href=\"/the-kid/3005-16987\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16987\">the Kid's</a> ability to double jump and <a href=\"/jill/3005-16969\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16969\">Jill's</a> ability to stall her descent.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283745\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283745\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Over the course of the game, new mechanics are introduced and obstacles become more complex. These include rising tides of lava, portals, magnetic fields, fans, lava rocks, and eventually enemies that hunt down the player character. All obstacles will result in instantaneous death upon contact. The \"<a href=\"/bosses/3015-229\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a>\" are equally indestructible; instead of actually fighting them, these levels require players to navigate difficult puzzles under time restraints until a <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene</a> is triggered.</p><p>Players can also collect bandages scattered around certain levels to unlock characters and certain levels. In order for the player to keep Bandages, they must collect them and successfully reach the exit in one attempt. Some bandages require specific characters and all are difficult to collect, especially in the purple Warp Zones, where players must not only collect the Bandage, but clear each of the three levels with a limited number of lives.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>Super Meat Boy features five main worlds, each with forty regular levels. The initial twenty levels are referred to as the \"Light World\". If the player is able to clear a Light World level under its par time, they will be able to access the \"Dark World\" counterpart (which shares the same basic geometry, but has a different appearance and increased difficulty). Each Light World version of the five main worlds also include a boss level, which must be completed in order to progress to the next world. Boss levels are unlocked after the player beats 17 out of the 20 Light World levels.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406229\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406229\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. </figcaption></figure><p>Along the way, players can also find purple <a href=\"/warp-zone/3015-804\" data-ref-id=\"3015-804\">Warp Zones</a> within certain levels. These portals vanish after a set period of time during the level attempt, though reaching these portals makes the Warp Zone available in the level selection screen. Entering a Warp Zone will transport Meat Boy (regardless of which character reaches the warp zone) to a retro-themed zone which is notably difficult. Each zone comes with three levels that must be completed consecutively with a special version of Meat Boy. Bandages are found within these warp zones, but the player will only have three attempts per level to collect them and clear the Warp Zone. If Meat Boy dies during the final attempt at any level, all bandages found during the Warp Zone attempt will be reset, and the player will be kicked back to the level selection screen. Replays and par times are unavailable for Warp Zones.</p><p>Red Warp Zones function similarly to purple Warp Zones but are played instead with a secret character. There are no bandages in red warp zones but there are also unlimited lives. There are only five red warp zones, one in each of the main Light Worlds. Each main world also has a special \"<a href=\"/glitch/3015-511\" data-ref-id=\"3015-511\">glitch</a> zone\", reached by getting to Bandage Girl while she is in a randomly occurring \"glitch state\". Glitch zones feature no bandages and only one level, which is typically longer and more difficult than any of the world's Warp Zones.</p><h3>Chapter 1: The Forest</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../street-fighter-ii/61-243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Lil' Slugger (giant walking chainsaw driven by Dr. Fetus)</p><p>The Forest introduces buzzsaws, static sawblade launchers, and impassable tiles that crumble away soon after the player touches it.</p><h3>Chapter 2: The Hospital</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../castlevania/61-6673/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Castlevania</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/chad/3005-15923\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15923\">C.H.A.D.</a> (mutated living abomination of blood and tissue)</p><p>The Hospital introduces fans, crawling slimes that stick to surfaces, floating enemies that bounce around aimlessly, piles of deadly needles, keys that unlock certain tiles, and timed laser beams.</p><h3>Chapter 3: The Salt Factory</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../the-adventures-of-lolo/61-5026/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Adventures of Lolo</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/brownie/3005-17017\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17017\">Brownie</a></p><p>The Salt Factory introduces harmful salt, homing missile launchers, moving platforms, tiles that only crumble away after coming in to contact with a missile, and high-speed conveyor belts.</p><h3>Chapter 4: Hell</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../ninja-gaiden/61-1653/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ninja Gaiden</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/little-horn/3005-17018\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17018\">Little Horn</a> (monster made of Meat Boy corpses)</p><p>Hell introduces lava pits (that sometimes rise), moving lava rocks, portals, rotating eyes that slowly lock on to the player while shooting laser beams, and demon homing missiles that split in to separate small missiles on impact.</p><h3>Chapter 5: Rapture</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../mega-man-2/61-14026/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mega Man 2</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Larrie's Lament (a group of enormous carnivorous worms)</p><p>Rapture introduces orbs that repulse the player, abominations (both running and flying) that head towards the player, and homing sawblade launchers.</p><h3>Chapter 6: The End</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"/pokemon-redblue/3030-3966\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3966\">Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/dr-fetus/3005-15922\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15922\">Dr. Fetus</a></p><p>Unlocked after completing Chapter 5, The End includes five regular levels (with both Light World and Dark World variations) that can only be played by Meat Boy and are designed to test the player's mastery of previous concepts.

Like in that game, the player is running inside a 360 loop with platforms on all side, the goal of each level is to discover the element within each level, the player accomplishes this by running on certain blue platforms spread across each level until a meter reaches 100% or above. Reaching the blue spaces are easier said than done, each level is randomly generated and platforms constantly fall from the sky, meaning that it is impossible to view too much of the course up ahead.Players can jump in three directions (Forward, left or right) jumping left or right causes the level to rotate however it can only rotate once per jump.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players may choose their protagonist, given the option of a male scientist, a female scientist, and a robot. Character choice does not affect gameplay in any way.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Levels are broken down into three groups of six. There are the standard particles, Dark particles, and Anti-particles, each group being progressively more difficult. Within each group, the same six particles are found: Geon, Acceleron, Radion, Graviton, Y Boson, and X Boson.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Levels vary significantly in pattern, speed, additional hazards, and shape. Each level has a different set of patterns and speed at which those patterns approach to challenge the player with, as is expected of any runner. Some levels, however, include not only platforms of various heights and gaps between them, but a rotating beam that must be dodged or walls that prevent the player from moving or seeing through that section. Certain levels will also include red platforms that begin to fall once the player lands their character on them.

Delving deeper and deeper into his tragically-ended relationship with the love of his life, Tim reflects on his lost love as he progresses through the game's six worlds, slowly revealing details to the player as he or she progresses.</p><p>The story is told exclusively through text, and is displayed as Tim approaches various pedestal-placed books in the clouds-levels' prologue screen. Each book contains vague, possibly metaphorical information about the protagonist's life. The story is reflective of the gameplay, in that Tim can rewind time to fix his faults, but chose not to/was unable to during what was apparently the biggest mistake of his life. The developers are aiming to reach out to players and evoke an emotional response, and the subtle sadness throughout reflects that concept.</p><p>Although the story told throughout most of the game is about a break up or lost love, it's really only there to give the player a reason to play through and set up the general theme of the level. The story, as told from the prologue/epilogue and hinted at by the hidden ending - in which Tim catches the princess and she explodes - is actually about Tim's obsession and eventual regret with creating the atomic bomb between the two World Wars. The \"princess\" he is trying to find is actually the bomb itself.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/925775-braid6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925775\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/925775-braid6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925775\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/925775-braid6.jpg\"/></a></figure><p>The primary principle of Braid is that players are to learn from their mistakes, rather than be penalized for them. That said, any time a player in the game dies, they can simply press the Rewind button to go back to the point before they died, and try again. With this concept, the challenge of the game is not in staying alive, but rather learning how time works in that specific world and mastering it to collect puzzle pieces to move on. There is a lobby area in-game for players to choose the world they wish to play. Players can also use the puzzle pieces collected in the various levels to form a picture near each world's finale. These puzzles can be used to manipulate the world as well, such as luring a baddie to low ground with a make-shift bridge formed from a jig-saw puzzle in order to earn the last piece in an unreachable spot at the end of World 2.</p><p>Certain objects cannot be affected by the rewind feature. Anything with a green glow will continue to advance as normal; clouds shot from cannons often illuminate the green aura to create jumping puzzles that require timing and forethought. Keys or platforms that are lit by green sparkles can be moved through time; for example, if Tim picks up a key that is luminescent-green, he can rewind from the pit he picked it up in and hop back to the top of the cliff while still holding on to it. Anything in purple, however, will automatically reset, or continue its desired path regardless of time travel. Lavender-lit keys can't be picked up and carried through time, as Tim drops it where he left it in the Rewind.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5962/641772-braid_screenshot10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-641772\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5962/641772-braid_screenshot10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-641772\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5962/641772-braid_screenshot10.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5962/641772-braid_screenshot10.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Tim must manipulate time to solve puzzles.</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes, Tim will need to duplicate himself by rewinding. As Braid is constantly changing the rules, players will need to be clever enough to figure out the patterns at which Tim's \"shadow\" moves and acts - if players hold still before rewinding time, the clone will while players hold the rewind button. This becomes tricky as players are forced to manipulate multiple levers on various planes of height, and reality. Conquering a specific boss requires dropping shadow-chandeliers, as the enemy requires a half-dozen or so hits to kill, while players are offered but two chandeliers to deal damage with.</p><p>By completing levels entirely - gathering all the puzzle pieces - players can make their way to the attic, the first level, and presumably Tim's origin of regret. Fully completing a jig-saw puzzle unlocks a fifth of a colored ladder that leads to the top of Tim's house, which consists of multiple rooms and five playable worlds (aside from the sixth and last, which is actually World 1). Unlocking the puzzle pieces requires players to simply pick them up, but certain objectives must be met in specific situations, such as manipulating time in specific ways in order to jump higher/repeatedly and eliminating all enemies on screen to unlock a caged piece.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Developer Jonathon Blow said in an interview with Gamasutra that difficulties with <a href=\"/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a> hindered his development process on Braid. In the interview, he stated \"[Microsoft] removed some of the requirements for XBLA games, but there are still a lot of requirements, and I believe that, at least for a single-player game like my game, the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary\".</p><p>Art was a huge focal point of Braid's development, and artist <a href=\"/david-hellman/3040-90246\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90246\">David Hellman</a> created a <a href=\"http://www.davidhellman.net/blog/category/art-of-braid/\" rel=\"nofollow\">series</a> of blog entries on the Braid Blog to give readers an insight as to where the game came from conceptually.</p><h2>Influences</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-214699\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214699-1177890880_02.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214699-1177890880_02.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214699\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/775/214699-1177890880_02.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/775/214699-1177890880_02.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Mario Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>The game is influenced by, and pays homage to the <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros</a>. games most of all. There are many similarities, from the pattern of the enemies, to the way players kill them and even the line \"The Princess is in another castle\". However it doesn't just do this as simple homage, it is also a succinct metaphor for Tim's journey. The use of that one phrase signifies Tim's search, and he can't find what he is looking for.</p><p>At certain points in World 4, Tim is to climb a series of ladders to grab a key. In a nod to <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3030-311\" data-ref-id=\"3030-311\">Donkey Kong</a>, the enemy-firing cannons have an ugly gorilla design on their side, representing <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo's</a> classic Kong. One such stage is named <a href=\"/jumpman/3030-19687\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19687\">Jumpman</a>, which was Mario's original name in Donkey Kong. But even though Braid appears to be a platformer, it is more of a puzzle game, and its pure gameplay influences come from other platform puzzle games.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>Braid's soundtrack consists of licensed music from artists signed to Magnatune. Artists include <a href=\"/jami-sieber/3040-90110\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90110\">Jami Sieber</a>, <a href=\"/shira-kammen/3040-90111\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90111\">Shira Kammen</a>, and Cheryl Ann Fulton. Links to the songs from the game can be found <a href=\"http://braid-game.com/news/?p=260\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>Braid was well recieved critically and commercially. It earned a Metacritic rating of 93%, making it one of the highest rated XBLA releases. It saw more than 55,000 purchases in the first week of release and Blow has stated that the game was financially \"very profitable\".</p><p>Critically, the game was considered a masterpiece by many. The artwork and puzzle design were universally praised, though the most common downside cited was the game's short length. Braid is frequently <a href=\"http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">brought up</a> in \"games as art\" arguments.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC</h3><ul><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae XP / Vista / 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 1.4GHz or faster</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 768 MB or more</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 200 MB or more</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> Pixel Shader 2.0</li><li><strong>DirectX\u00ae Version:</strong> DirectX\u00ae 9.0c</li><li><strong>Controller Support:</strong> Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for Windows</li></ul><h3>Mac</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Mac 1.0 GHz or better</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> ATI Radeon(TM) 9500 or better, NVIDIA GeForce(TM) FX 5900 or better, Intel GMA 950 or better</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 185 MB free space</li></ul>", "deck": "Manipulate time to complete puzzles in this 2D platform game made by indie developer, Jonathan Blow.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1331143-braid_box.png", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1331143-braid_box.png", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1331143-braid_box.png", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1331143-braid_box.png", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1331143-braid_box.png", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1331143-braid_box.png", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1331143-braid_box.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/braid/3030-20716/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20716/", "number_of_user_reviews": 77, "original_release_date": "2008-08-06 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/", "id": 29, "name": "ESRB: E10+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/", "id": 36, "name": "PEGI: 12+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/", "id": 38, "name": "OFLC: PG"}], "date_added": "2008-06-05 16:06:09", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/", "abbreviation": "XBGS", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/", "id": 86, "name": "Xbox 360 Games Store"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-88/", "abbreviation": "PS3N", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/", "id": 88, "name": "PlayStation Network (PS3)"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/", "abbreviation": "LIN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/", "id": 152, "name": "Linux"}], "id": 20716, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Braid"}, "platform": "Xbox 360", "title": "Braid"}

It has fast-paced, gritty, old-school action. Contra III is the first game in the Contra series to allow the player to hold two weapons, making it a landmark title in the franchise. In addition to that change, the power of the Super Nintendo allowed for larger, more detailed sprites and much more complex level design. Players can now jump on bars and climb on them monkey-bar style, climb walls and ladders, destroy various objects (such as the car right in front of the player in the very first level), and vehicles (such as a tank in the first level). New levels include one in which the player must jump between missiles while destroying an enemy ship, riding on a motorcycle while speeding down a road, riding on a jet ski, and two <a href=\"/mode-7/3015-184\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7</a> top-down levels.</p><p>In the Mode 7 levels, the player controls the view using the two shoulder buttons (R and L). By pressing these buttons, the camera rotates around. At the start of the stage, the player gets to choose where to be dropped in. Navigating around the area and destroying various targets eventually leads the player to a boss, which must be disposed of in a fashion similar to the 2D side-scrolling bosses.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>If the Contra series has been known for anything, it's the wide variety of weapon power-ups available to the player. The letter next to each weapon in parenthesis detonates which lettered power-up awards the weapon to the player. By tapping the X button (standard controls), the player can swap between two weapon slots. If killed, only the weapon in the current slot will be taken away from the player as a penalty. Note that tapping X while shooting will rapidly switch weapons, allowing the player to fire anything twice as fast (within the physical limits of the player in question). Also, holding both shoulder buttons and pressing fire will result in a spinning attack with both equipped weapons being fired 360 degrees.</p><ol><li><b>Machine Gun (N/A)</b> - The starting weapon of Contra III. Has a high rate of fire, but only shoots in one direction and has very low damage.</li><li><b>Spread Shot (S)</b> - Essentially the shotgun of the game. Fires out five weak shots that shoot out in five directions in front of the shooter. Excellent for clearing out crowds of foes and does good damage to bosses at close range. Not nearly as overpowered as in previous games in the series.</li><li><b>Homing Missiles (H)</b> - Weak missiles that seek out enemy targets.</li><li><b>Laser (L)</b> - A powerful gun that fires out one shot in side-scrolling levels, but turns into a continuous beam when in a top-down level. Takes down bosses with great speed.</li><li><b>Shield (B)</b> - Gives the player temporary invincibility to everything except for falling off the screen.</li><li><b>Bomb</b> <b>(has the appearance of a bomb)</b> - Sends out a circular wave of destruction that slowly spreads over the entire screen. Damages bosses and will instantly destroy most normal enemies. After each death, players will respawn with one bomb, and more can be obtained as weapon pickups.</li><li><b>Crush Missile (C)</b> - With the exception of the bomb, the strongest weapon in the game. It has short range, but incredible splash damage to compensate. When paired with another Crush Missile, it can take down bosses faster than any other weapon.</li><li><b>Flame (F)</b> - A flamethrower. Short range but can pass through barriers, making it ideal for certain situations. Also, when holding the fire button and switching the direction of fire, the flame will move in a waving pattern instead of snapping to the new direction like other weapons, providing a wider range of fire.</li></ol><h2>Mode 7</h2><p>Contra III: The Alien Wars made use of the <a href=\"/mode-7/3015-184\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7</a> graphics mode of the Super Nintendo throughout the game.

Its gameplay utilizes mechanics commonly seen in <a href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\">Metroidvania</a> action-adventure games, such as areas which are inaccessible until later upgrades are obtained, and furthermore it shares similarities with Capcom's own <a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man series</a>, as evidenced by its <a href=\"/level-selection/3015-178\" data-ref-id=\"3015-178\">level selection</a> mechanics and <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a>, which often become much easier to defeat with certain weapons.

In a similar fashion to the <a href=\"/metroid/3030-21761\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21761\">Metroid series</a>, Demon's Crest features multiple endings which unfurl differently depending upon the player's item collection percentage at the time they choose to access the game's final battle against Phalanx, which opens up fairly early on.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>In a time long past, the world was divided into two realms, with one realm ruled by <a href=\"/human/3015-810\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">man</a>, and the other the dominion of demons. For many years the two kingdoms were peaceful, until one fateful day six powerful crests fell from the sky into the demons' lands. The demons began to fight amongst themselves over the control of these mysterious artifacts, as it was rumored their combined magics were sufficient to make those who possessed them powerful beyond measure. Eventually, a single red demon by the name of Firebrand proved to be more cunning and vicious than his brethren, securing the Crests of Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and Time for himself. Not content to have only five of the six crests, however, Firebrand challenged the demon <a href=\"/dragons/3015-551\" data-ref-id=\"3015-551\">dragon</a> Somulo for possession of the final crest, the Crest of Heaven. The ensuing battle tested both combatants to their limits, but ultimately the demon dragon succumbed, and Firebrand emerged as the undisputed master of the crests.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2020402-phalanx_crests.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020402\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2020402-phalanx_crests.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020402\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2020402-phalanx_crests.png\"/></a><figcaption>Phalanx obtains the coveted crests.</figcaption></figure><p>Firebrand's control over the six crests was brief, however. Taking to the skies following his battle with Somulo, Firebrand finds himself attacked unexpectedly by another of his kind, the scheming Phalanx, who took advantage of his weakened state in order to pry the crests from him. Though his exact motives are unclear, Phalanx harbors ambitions of ruling over both the human and demon realms, and he knows that the crests will give him the power to do so. Phalanx successfully wrests all six crests from his wounded opponent, though a single shard of the Crest of Fire, which splintered into five pieces during the fight, still remains in Firebrand's possession at the end of their confrontation.</p><p>Defeated but still alive, Firebrand swears to take revenge against the opportunistic Phalanx and reacquire the crests. His vengeance will not be easy, though. Wary that some jealous demon would come to take the crests from him in the same manner that he took them from Firebrand, Phalanx separates the crests and spreads them arcross the demon realm, keeping only the Crest of Heaven on his person. Before he can properly challenge Phalanx for the Crest of Heaven, Firebrand must first search the land for the four hidden crests while also recovering the shattered remnants of the Crest of Fire. Time is of the essence. Phalanx intends to use the six crests to create the Crest of Infinity, which would make him unstoppable. Only the small sliver of the Crest of Fire which remains in Firebrand's possession prevents him from doing so.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The main action of Demon's Crest takes place on traditional side-scrolling levels, many of which contain archetypal stage themes (<a href=\"/lava-stage/3015-532\" data-ref-id=\"3015-532\">fire level</a>, <a href=\"/water-level/3015-1713\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1713\">water level</a>, <a href=\"/ice-stage/3015-2076\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2076\">ice level</a>, etc.), in which players must travel from left to right, defeating or avoiding enemies, navigating environmental hazards like <a href=\"/spikes/3055-183\" data-ref-id=\"3055-183\">spikes</a> and <a href=\"/fire/3015-1443\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1443\">flames</a>, and occasionally squaring off against bosses. While the game's introductory stage is predetermined, after its completion players are allowed to choose their next location by flying Firebrand there via an <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld</a>, which essentially acts as a level selection interface. Important locations (that is, those that are tied to the player's main quest) are marked on the map in order to indicate their significance, while a number of other secondary shops and hidden locales can be access through exploration. While accessible stages can be played in any order, their difficulty, and thus their intended order of completion, is signified by a numeric indicator on the game's <a href=\"/world-map/3015-611\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">world map</a>. Progress is furthermore gated by levels which will only unlock once certain conditions have been met within the currently available levels.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2020487-overworldtravel.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020487\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2020487-overworldtravel.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020487\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2020487-overworldtravel.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2020487-overworldtravel.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Firebrand performs a flyby over Phalanx's Tower.</figcaption></figure><p>The main reward of level completion comes in the form of upgrades to the <a href=\"/player-character/3015-968\" data-ref-id=\"3015-968\">player character</a>, Firebrand. Bosses typically yield boons such as crests, new abilities, or health upgrades upon defeat, and the levels themselves often hide additional items such as talismans, which provide passive benefits, as well as urns and vellum, which can be used for potions and spellcasting respectively. Many levels include branching pathways which encourage additional playthroughs, and it is often necessary to revisit earlier levels with abilities acquired later on, as completion of certain side paths may be extremely difficult or entirely impossible without a particular item. Once a player has completed a certain amount of the game, the Tower of Phalanx is unlocked. From that point forward, the player is free to engage the game's final battle when they see fit. Players who resist the urge to challenge Phalanx immediately are rewarded with better endings and the possibility of additional post-ending content based on their completion percentage upon finishing the final battle.</p><p>When not tackling the game's main stages, the player can access several non-combat areas via the overworld. These mostly consist of shops which allow players to purchase one-time use potions and spells for Firebrand with currency gathered throughout the game. Additional urns and vellum increase the maximum number of potions and spells that can be stored at one time, though ultimately gold is also required in order to purchase them. Outside of purchasing items, activities in these neutral areas is somewhat limited. A few <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">non-player characters</a> can be engaged with, and an additional <a href=\"/headbutt/3015-3215\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3215\">headbutting</a> <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-game</a> can be played for fun and profit. It is in the player's best interest to use what currency they find, as the game's <a href=\"/password/3015-38\" data-ref-id=\"3015-38\">password</a> system does not carry over money or consumable items when continuing a game.</p><h2>Fire Crest Projectiles</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2017678-firebrand.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017678\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5925925925926\" data-width=\"54\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 54px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2017678-firebrand.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017678\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2017678-firebrand.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2017678-firebrand.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Normal Gargoyle</figcaption></figure><p>Broken into five pieces at the game's outset, the Crest of Fire is tied intrinsically to Firebrand's default form, the Normal Gargoyle. The player starts with only one fragment of the crest in their possession at the game's commencement, and unlike other crests, each additional piece of the Crest of Fire must be gathered individually before the crest can be considered whole. The basic abilities of his normal form include the use of his wings to hover after jumping, utilization of his talons to indefinitely cling to non-spiked wall surfaces, and headbutting, which breaks certain background items. These traits do not change with the acquisition of additional fire shards, nor does Firebrand's appearance, but new shards grant Firebrand access to additional projectiles while in his default state, each with their own properties. Only one of the available projectile types can be in active use at any given time, and furthermore these cannot be used concurrently with other crests, though players can cycle between the different projectile types at will through the game's menu.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2017677-fire.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017677\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.29166666666667\" data-width=\"48\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 48px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:29.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2017677-fire.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017677\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2017677-fire.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2017677-fire.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Fire</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>Fire</h3> The fireball is a staple of the Red Arremer clan, and the only ability which Firebrand starts the game with.

Once an individual crest is found, Firebrand may use it at any later point to transform into a version of himself which is imbued with the powers of that particular crest. He may then stay in any of these forms indefinitely, though it is often prudent to switch between crests frequently depending on the situation. Additional forms grant abilities that Firebrand's default form does not have access to, and in fact many areas of the game are designed such that certain crests will be better suited than others.</p><p>As powerful as they are, It is worth noting that switching to new forms may cause the player to lose abilities that are available to them in the default form. For instance, certain transformations are wingless, and therefor have no ability to hover, while several forms also lack Firebrand's basic headbutt ability, which is accessible to him from the start of the game. This means that it can sometimes be wise to fall back on Firebrand's basic gargoyle form, which has a more well-rounded set of abilities. This is especially true of forms which are more specialized in nature, such as the Tidal Gargoyle.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017680\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.56\" data-width=\"50\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 50px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017680\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2017680-ground_gargoyle.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Ground Gargoyle</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>Crest of Earth</h3> Received after the player's first confrontation with Arma, the Crest of Earth transforms Firebrand into a mighty Ground Gargoyle.

Once a player possesses vellum, spells can be inscribed upon them by special vendors within the game world, provided the player has enough money for the particular spell. Once the spell has been used, the vellum returns to a blank state, and must be inscribed with a spell once again before it can be reused.

The abuse she endured as a child reinforced her belief in the cult, believing that her suffering would be reversed upon the arrival of <a href=\"/samael/3005-3129\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3129\">Samael</a>.</p><h4><a href=\"/vincent/3005-6300\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6300\"><b>Vincent</b></a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/19/192184/2517608-vincent2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2517608\" data-ratio=\"1.3228571428571\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/19/192184/2517608-vincent2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2517608\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/19/192184/2517608-vincent2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/19/192184/2517608-vincent2.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Vincent is another cult-member with his own agenda. He seems to favor the whole cult, but seems to be a bit more realistic than Claudia is.

In the Alternate Hospital's basement, Stanley calls Heather by the telephone to wish her happy birthday even though it wasn't her birthday.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Plot</h3><p>As a direct sequel to the first game Silent Hill 3 begins 17 years after the events of <a href=\"/silent-hill/3030-4312\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4312\">Silent Hill</a>. This time around <a href=\"/heather-mason/3005-2723\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2723\">Heather Mason</a>, daughter of <a href=\"/harry-mason/3005-1109\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1109\">Harry Mason</a>, finds her world infested with bizarre monsters. The game starts with Heather in a nightmarish version of <a href=\"/lakeside-amusement-park/3035-1393\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1393\">Silent Hill's Amusement Park</a>; and is where the main character Heather Mason understands something has gone horribly wrong: she sees that the Amusement Park has gone to hell; with blood all over the place, and monsters a-lurkin'. After a shocking moment, Heather wakes up just to find herself in a burger shop- but was it really a nightmare?</p><p>She later stumbles upon a person called <a href=\"/douglas-cartland/3005-6298\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6298\">Douglas Cartland</a> in a mall; the 50 year-old-detective tries to get Heather to go with him to have a conversation about her birth, but Heather refuses. Due to Douglas's persistence, Heather decides to save herself by going into the lady's room. From there she sees the first weird sign right over a mirror: that sign was the same one she saw in her nightmares.</p><p>Later, Heather stumbles upon a monster, and from there she experiences a ride into hell. She then meets a woman called <a href=\"/claudia-wolf/3005-6299\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6299\">Claudia</a>, a lady who asks Heather : \"Remember me and your true self as well\". To the question \"What are those monsters,\" she responds: \"They have come to witness the beginning of the world spoiled by mankind.\"</p><p>After surviving from the deadly mall by killing a split worm, Heather finds herself in the normal world again. She encounters Douglas again, but this time he is scared and has seen the monsters himself. Heather decides to take the subway home, but as you might expect, she again encounters the weird monsters. After getting out of the subway and reaching her apartment, Heather witnesses the most bitter scene of her entire life: her father, <a href=\"/harry-mason/3005-1109\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1109\">Harry Mason</a> (protagonists of the first game), lies on a couch- bloody and lifeless. After crying over his dead body, Heather follows the trail of blood to the rooftop just to find her father's killer standing beside Claudia. She asks the reason behind this evil deed and Claudia in return says: <i>\"Someday you'll understand the reason in</i> <i>Silent Hill</i>.\" Heather manages to kill his father's murderer and vowed to avenge her father's death, but must travel to Silent Hill. Douglas gives her a ride to Silent Hill, where she finds out she was adopted by Harry mason as a child.</p><p>After arriving in Silent Hill, she starts looking for clues on how to find Claudia. She visits various places like <a href=\"/alchemilla-hospital/3035-1599\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1599\">Alchemila Hospital</a> and <a href=\"/lakeside-amusement-park/3035-1393\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1393\">Lakeside Amusement Park</a>. She also meets two new characters, one called Leonard Wolf- the father of Claudia- and the other is a sneaky monk called <a href=\"/vincent/3005-6300\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6300\">Vincent</a>. Later Heather understands that she needs to find Claudia in the town's <a href=\"/church/3035-1395\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1395\">Church</a>. The reason behind all these monsters, nightmares and pain would be explained by Claudia as the means to make Heather angry and full of hatred, resulting in <i>\"God's birth\"</i>.</p><p>Heather then learns that she carries God (Satan) in her womb. At the end of the church Heather meets Claudia and Vincent talking about the God's Birth which ends up with Vincent being stabbed and killed by Claudia. Heather then swallows a ruby (<a href=\"/aglaophotis/3055-454\" data-ref-id=\"3055-454\">Aglaophotis</a>) that Harry once gave her, and throws up the God. The desperate Claudia attempts to give birth to God herself soon after, which leads to Heather killing them and avenging her father's death. At the final scene we understand that Heather Mason was indeed <a href=\"/cheryl-mason/3005-2724\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2724\">Cheryl</a>/ <a href=\"/alessa-gillespie/3005-1102\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1102\">Alessa</a>, the girl whom Harry was looking for throughout the events of first Silent Hill game. Silent Hill 3 ends with the God finally destroyed and the cult officially gone from Silent Hill.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><h3>Common enemies</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/numb-body/3015-6013\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6013\">Numb Body</a></li><li><a href=\"/double-head/3015-6015\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6015\">Double Head</a></li><li><a href=\"/pendulum/3015-6016\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6016\">Pendulum</a></li><li><a href=\"/insane-cancer/3015-6017\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6017\">Insane Cancer</a></li><li><a href=\"/closer/3015-6014\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6014\">Closer</a></li><li><a href=\"/slurper/3015-6018\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6018\">Slurper</a></li><li><a href=\"/alchemilla-nurses/3015-5724\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5724\">Nurse</a></li><li><a href=\"/scrapers/3015-6019\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6019\">Scraper</a></li><li><a href=\"/valtiel/3005-7419\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7419\">Valtiel</a></li></ul><h3>Bosses</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/split-head/3005-16599\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16599\">Split Head</a></li><li><a href=\"/glutton/3015-6059\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6059\">Glutton</a></li><li><a href=\"/missionary/3015-6060\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6060\">Missionary</a></li><li><a href=\"/leonard-wolf/3005-13334\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13334\">Leonard Wolf</a></li><li>Memory of <a href=\"/alessa-gillespie/3005-1102\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1102\">Alessa</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-god/3005-16604\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16604\">The God</a></li></ul><h2>Endings</h2><p>As with past games, there are multiple endings available in Silent Hill 3. Which ending the player receives depends on criteria such as choices, damage taken, number of enemies killed, and whether or not certain items were used.</p><p>Note that upon a first completion, only the Normal ending is possible.</p><h3>Normal</h3><p>Heather goes back to the amusement park and the town has returned to its normal state. She approaches Douglas wielding a knife and acting strangely. It seems like she plans to kill him, but stops and laughs that it was just a joke. Douglas thinks she has a twisted sense of humor. Heather then insists he call her Cheryl, the name given by her father Harry. When Douglas asks if this means she plans to go back to her original hair color of black, she replies that blonds have more fun. The game ends with a shot of Heather visiting Harry's grave.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1465883-normal.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465883\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6137339055794\" data-width=\"466\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 466px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1465883-normal.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465883\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57879/1465883-normal.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57879/1465883-normal.png\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>HOW TO OBTAIN: Awarded on a first completion. If playing on Extra New Game, players must not exceed 4,000 points over the course of the game. To do this simply avoid killing enemies unless necessary, take little health damage, and say nothing to the confessor in the church.</p><h3>Possessed</h3><p>In the amusement park, blood is dripping onto the ground and the camera shows Heather standing motionless wielding a knife<i>,</i> while the town remains in its alternate state. Slowly the scene pans to reveal Douglas dead and bloodied, apparently having been murdered by Heather. The game ends with Heather standing over his lifeless body.</p><p>HOW TO OBTAIN: Players must earn 4,000 points over the course of the game. Ten points are received for each enemy the player kills, and a single point is obtained each time the player takes damage. Forgiving the confessor in the church awards players with an additional 1,000 points.</p><h3>Revenge</h3><p>This is the goofy ending in line with the UFO endings from past games. After arriving at Daisy Villa Apartments, storyboard-style scenes take place. Heather returns home to find that her father Harry isn't dead at all, but sitting at a table having tea with an alien. He addresses her as Cheryl and his voice is oddly distorted. James Sunderland, the protagonist from <a href=\"/silent-hill-2/3030-10780\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10780\">Silent Hill 2</a>, is in the background hiding behind a curtain. She explains to Harry about her experiences, then he suddenly goes into a rage and jump-kicks a wooden plank held by James into two pieces. Harry declares that he's going to go to Silent Hill and bust some heads; Heather and the alien cheer him on. Cut to a shot of the town being obliterated by a UFO attack. The game ends with a comical 'Silent Hill song' in Japanese, making comments about characters from the game.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1465870-revenge.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465870\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.64495798319328\" data-width=\"476\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 476px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57879/1465870-revenge.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465870\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/5/57879/1465870-revenge.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/5/57879/1465870-revenge.png\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>HOW TO OBTAIN: Players first need to unlock the Heather Beam/Sexy Beam by killing at least 333 enemies in total.

Resident Evil 2 primarily utilizes the same mechanics and gameplay styles as the previous <a href=\"/resident-evil/3030-5842\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil</a>, but with updated graphics and a new story set only three months after the original.</p><p>On August 12th, 2015, <a href=\"/resident-evil-2-remake-working-title/3030-50601\" data-ref-id=\"3030-50601\">a remake of Resident Evil 2</a> was finally announced after years of high demand from fans.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Overview &amp; Controls</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666480-_-resident-evil-2-gamecube-_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666480\" data-ratio=\"0.69945355191257\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666480-_-resident-evil-2-gamecube-_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666480\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666480-_-resident-evil-2-gamecube-_.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Claire aiming up towards an attacking Licker</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay of Resident Evil 2 is virtually the same as the gameplay of the first one, and features a mix of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving. Players move via a series of<a href=\"/fixed-camera/3015-1715\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1715\"> pre-determined camera angles</a> and control their character with '<a href=\"/tank-controls/3015-4647\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls</a>', much like most survival horror games of the era. Combat as such is rather rudimentary, as players simply aim their weapon with R1 and shoot with X (default PS1 controls). They can aim up or down this way as well, though with the assistance of auto-aim (which can be turned off) combat is a relatively simple affair. To make up for it, however, ammunition is scarce, and thusly forces players to choose between whether it's worth engaging in combat or attempting to flee.</p><p>The story is largely portrayed via cutscenes, both in-game and CG, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.</p><h3>Difficulty Settings</h3><p>There are two difficulty settings available across most ports of Resident Evil 2 -- Rookie and Normal. Normal plays much like how the game was intended, whereas Rookie lessens enemy health and gifts players some additional handgun ammunition and first aid sprays in the item box.</p><p>The PC version features a Hard difficulty setting, which increases enemy health and damage. The N64 version also has available an Arranged mode that mixes all of the items in the game around, similar to the mode found in <a href=\"/resident-evil-directors-cut/3030-10186\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10186\">Resident Evil: Director's Cut</a>.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><p>Like the original Resident Evil, there are two playable characters to choose from -- <a href=\"/leon-s-kennedy/3005-649\" data-ref-id=\"3005-649\">Leon S. Kennedy</a>, and <a href=\"/claire-redfield/3005-628\" data-ref-id=\"3005-628\">Claire Redfield</a>, sister of <a href=\"/chris-redfield/3005-413\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris Redfield</a>. However unlike the original, the two characters do in fact coincide and have varying storylines from one another, whereas both Chris &amp; Jill's were essentially the same minus a few details.</p><p>Mechanically-speaking the two characters are now practically identical to one another. They both can withstand the same degree of damage and have the same maximum inventory slots. The story itself dictates the differences, as it'll take each in slightly different directions of the <a href=\"/raccoon-city-police-department/3035-661\" data-ref-id=\"3035-661\">Raccoon Police Department</a>, and they each feature their own set of unique puzzles to solve, weapons to collect, and characters to meet.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633569-resident_evil_2_-_ada_wong.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633569\" data-ratio=\"0.63821138211382\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633569-resident_evil_2_-_ada_wong.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633569\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633569-resident_evil_2_-_ada_wong.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633569-resident_evil_2_-_ada_wong.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Ada Wong, supporting character amidst Leon's story</figcaption></figure><p>Leon's story will bring him into contact with femme-fatale, Ada Wong. Claiming to be a civilian on the search for her boyfriend, she will provide assistance to Leon throughout the game. On two occasions she will follow as an invincible AI companion for a short time, armed with a HP browning pistol. Alongside being invincible, she has infinite ammo (though must at least reload when necessary) and will help kill any enemies the two encounter through their travels.</p><p>Beyond those sequences, players will also be forced to take control of Ada on two occasions for story purposes. She controls exactly like Leon and Claire, and has available her HP Browning pistol and a single first aid spray. However her weapon stance is different from both characters, and it gives her an increase in firing rate with her pistol.</p><p>Claire too has a playable supporting character, however her's is the twelve year old Sherry Birkin. Like Ada, she too will function both as a friendly NPC and as a playable character. However because she is only twelve, she has no means of attack available. When following as an NPC, players cannot run off too far otherwise Sherry will crouch down and cower, awaiting Claire's return. When standing still Sherry and Claire will hold hands, though they will let go once Claire starts moving again.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633570-resident-evil-2-sherry-birkin-31185300-640-381.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633570\" data-ratio=\"0.5953125\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633570-resident-evil-2-sherry-birkin-31185300-640-381.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633570\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633570-resident-evil-2-sherry-birkin-31185300-640-381.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633570-resident-evil-2-sherry-birkin-31185300-640-381.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Sherry Birkin, a lost twelve year old girl</figcaption></figure><p>As a playable character she once again has no means of attack (she does at least have a first aid spray) and must attempt to avoid enemies. Though because of her small stature, zombies at least will not be able to bite her and will only attempt to vomit acid on her instead, which does considerably less damage. As well as having no means of attack, Sherry has a slower running speed than all the other characters in the game.</p><p>For the PS1 version their stories are restricted to their own disc--one for Leon, one for Claire--however most physical ports since then have compiled them onto one.</p><h3>The A and B Scenarios</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633627-resi2-456x342.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633627\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633627-resi2-456x342.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633627\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633627-resi2-456x342.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633627-resi2-456x342.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Claire &amp; Leon coming into contact during Scenarios Leon A / Claire B</figcaption></figure><p>Resident Evil 2 featured four different scenarios; the first two were labelled as Leon A and Claire B scenarios, where Leon entered the police station through the front entrance and Claire through the back door. The second two scenarios, labelled as Claire A and Leon B, had the roles reversed with the plotline slightly altered. Each scenario provided a different experience such as meeting with <a href=\"/robert-kendo/3005-2520\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2520\">Robert Kendo</a> and <a href=\"/marvin-branagh/3005-18452\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18452\">Marvin Branagh </a>on Scenario A, and being stalked by the T-103 'Mr. X' <a href=\"/tyrant/3015-8404\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8404\">Tyrant</a> during Scenario B.</p><p>Players first only have access to Leon &amp; Claire's A Scenario, though upon completing either will then be asked to create a new save slot for the alternate character's B Scenario.</p><p>There are a handful of player choices that can carry over from A Scenario to B. As either character, they will eventually stumble upon a minipack and submachine gun. The A Scenario character can choose to take it with them, or they could instead leave it for the B Scenario character to collect instead. There is also a room located within the Umbrella Lab near the end of the game that requires two hand print IDs to open. As such, it can only be opened once both Scenario characters have registered their hand print and then placed their hand on the scanner, allowing the B Scenario character to its contents.</p><p>They are the two most notable crossovers, though there are smaller effects as well, such as leaving the zombified Marvin Branagh alive in Scenario A, which will then have him continue to persist in the alternate character's B Scenario.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666481-1998-resident_evil_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666481\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666481-1998-resident_evil_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666481\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666481-1998-resident_evil_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666481-1998-resident_evil_2.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Claire &amp; Leon coming into contact during Scenarios Claire A / Leon B</figcaption></figure><p>Since Resident Evil 2 featured several different combinations of events and endings, it was for a time left ambiguous as to which ordering was the true version. However it was eventually confirmed by Capcom via the official Resident Evil timeline in <a href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5</a> that the canon order is the Claire A &amp; Leon B telling.</p><p>During Claire's B Scenario, there is only one segment of the game where players must control Sherry, as opposed to two in the A Scenario.</p><h3>Inventory</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633867-resident-evil-2-claire-inventory-screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633867\" data-ratio=\"0.74925373134328\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633867-resident-evil-2-claire-inventory-screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633867\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633867-resident-evil-2-claire-inventory-screenshot.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633867-resident-evil-2-claire-inventory-screenshot.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Inventory screen, with the character's health up top.</figcaption></figure><p>All characters across the game carry the same inventory space of eight slots, though each character also has a unique item in a static ninth slot. Leon at first has a lighter, which must otherwise be acquired within the RPD as Claire, and Claire has a lockpick. Though unlike Jill's capabilities in Resident Evil, Claire can only use it to open up locked drawers to acquire some additional supplies. Leon must instead locate small keys to open the drawers. Leon will also eventually replace his lighter with a G-Virus vial, though it is only carried for narrative purposes, serves no mechanical use, and is only temporary at that before he throws it away and finds himself with his lighter again.</p><p>Supporting characters Ada &amp; Sherry each only have a photograph; Ada's is of her and her boyfriend John, while Sherry's is of her and her parents, William and Annette Birkin. The photographs serve no mechanical use, however.</p><p>There are certain weapons that will take up 2 slots as opposed to one like everything else. These are:</p><ul><li>Submachine gun</li><li>Flamethrower</li><li>Spark Shot</li><li>Gatling Gun</li><li>Rocket Launcher</li></ul><p>Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/item-box/3055-6126\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6126\">item boxes</a> where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.</p><h3>Health &amp; Herbs/First Aid Sprays</h3><p>A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:</p><ul><li><strong>Fine (Green)</strong> - The character is in good health.</li><li><strong>Caution (Yellow)</strong> - The character is roughly at half health.</li><li><strong>Danger (Red)</strong> - The character is approaching death.</li><li><strong>Poison (Purple)</strong> - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.</li></ul><p>Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.</p><p>Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of <a href=\"/medical-herb/3055-566\" data-ref-id=\"3055-566\">herb</a>s to heal themselves and cure poisons. <a href=\"/first-aid-spray/3055-619\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid Spray</a>s are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:</p><ul><li><b>Green Herb</b> - On its own will restore 25% of health.</li><li><b>Blue Herb</b> - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.</li><li><b>Red Herb</b> - On its own does nothing.</li><li><b>Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Green Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Green + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.</li><li><b>Green + Red Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.</li><li><b>Green + Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.</li><li><b>Red + Blue Herb</b> - Mixed will do nothing.</li></ul><h3>Saving</h3><p>Like the original, Resident Evil 2 requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory.</p><h2>Story</h2><h3>Main Characters</h3><h4><a href=\"/leon-s-kennedy/3005-649\" data-ref-id=\"3005-649\">Leon S.

However William himself ambushes Annette; Annette, who has been slowly driven insane, tries to embrace what used to be her husband, but is viciously murdered by him. Claire is able to locate a file detailing the creation of the cure Sherry needs. Entering William's own lab, she is able to create the cure to eliminate the infection. With the cure in hand, the self-destruct mechanism also goes into motion. Unlocking all doors, this also opens up the emergency exit. After radioing Leon to bring Sherry to the emergency exit, Claire goes on the move to meet them.</p><p>After locating the elevator that'll take her down to the escape train, William Birkin bursts through the wall above and mutates even further. Now taking the form of a kind of huge canine creature, it attacks Claire. With a five minute timer ticking down, Claire is once again able to defend herself against Birkin. As it begins to decompose, Claire boards the elevator. The train has already begun to move, with Leon shouting for Claire to jump on. She does so and administers the cure to Sherry; it works, providing relief for both Claire and Leon.</p><h4>Leon S.

Upon entering the station, however, a helicopter can be seen trying to rescue a police officer. However zombies arrive and begin to feast on the officer, all the while he erratically begins to fire his submachine gun, killing the pilot and forcing him to crash.</p><p>Making his way past the destruction and entering the station, another helicopter soon arrives, but instead drops a large container containing the Umbrella created <a href=\"/tyrant/3015-8404\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8404\">Tyrant </a>T-103. It slowly begins to walk towards Leon and attacks him, forcing Leon to kill it.</p><p>Amidst his exploration, he encounters a small girl who quickly runs away. He gives chase, but she escapes via a small hole in the wall. Heading back down to the corridor he is reunited with Claire. Leon hands her a radio so they can keep in contact, while stating that they must search for fellow survivors and escape the city. Claire agrees, and the two split-up once more.</p><p>Heading down to the station's car lot Leon is shot at by a woman, though she misses. She apologises after mistaking him for a zombie and introduces herself as Ada Wong. She is searching for her boyfriend John. Leon offers to help, and the two are then able to push a parked truck out of the way so as to gain access to the station's jail quarters.</p><p>From there they meet Ben Bertolucci, a journalist who was investigating corruption within the RPD and is a contact of Ada's. He has purposely locked himself in a jail cell to help provide protection from the zombies and other monsters roaming the station. In a bid to help them escape the city, he suggests that their best bet would be the sewers. Ada then rushes off on her own.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666461-gaming-resident-evil2-4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666461\" data-ratio=\"0.64239482200647\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666461-gaming-resident-evil2-4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666461\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666461-gaming-resident-evil2-4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666461-gaming-resident-evil2-4.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Ada &amp; Leon meeting Ben Bertolucci</figcaption></figure><p>Leon attempts to catch up to Ada via the sewers and suggests they work together. Noticing a crawlspace up top, Ada asks Leon to give her a boost to investigate. He complies, and allows Ada to go off on her own. Upon entering through the crawlspace she encounters a small girl. The surprise forces the girl to drop her pendant and run away. Ada collects the pendant, and upon opening it up notices a small vial containing a purple substance.</p><p>Ada locates some supplies to which she throws through the crawlspace to Leon, but then opts to head off on her own as she can't reach the crawlspace from her end. Nearby is a door that leads further into the sewers, only it's locked with a strange chess piece puzzle mechanism. Leon explores the station for the pieces required, though throughout his travels he is continually hounded by the T-103 tyrant. Leon is able to successfully defend himself each time, though it still continues to show up despite the damage it is dealt.</p><p>Upon returning to the underground Leon hears Ben scream in terror. Arriving to his aid, he notices Ben bloodied and battered. Ben gives Leon evidence incriminating Chief Brian Irons' involvement with the Umbrella Corporation, and the corporation's nefarious schemes. Ben shortly dies from his injuries.</p><p>Returning to the locked chess piece door, Leon encounters what looks to be a man. The man then begins to mutate and grow a large eye into his right arm. He then pulls off a pipe and begins to slowly advance towards Leon. Leon is able to do enough damage to the monster to force it to fall over the edge into the sewers below.</p><p>Unlocking the door and entering the sewers himself, Leon again encounters Ada. He scolds her for running away and asks that they stick together. Ada complies, stating she'll ''do things your way, for now''. The two continue through the sewers, however after heading down an elevator Ada notices a female scientist. She chases after her but the scientist begins firing; Leon then quickly dives in front of Ada, while being shot in the process. He falls unconscience while the scientist runs away. Ada then gives chase.</p><p>Finally managing to catch up to her, the scientist shoots Ada's weapon out of her hand and identifies herself as Annette Birkin. She tells of Umbrella's betrayal of she and her husband William Birkin, and how William injected himself with his own G-Virus after an attack on his life by Umbrella Security Service agents. The G-Virus turned him into a monster as he soon slaughtered the U.S.S. agents, minus one -- <a href=\"/hunk/3005-3859\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3859\">HUNK</a>.

Being aware of her true intentions, Annette then attempts to kill Ada; the two engage in a struggle, with Ada slapping Annette forcing her to fall over the edge of the railing. Ada attempts to grab her hand, but to no avail and sarcastically responds with ''too bad''.</p><p>Leon manages to wake up and goes after Ada despite his injuries. Finding her nearby to where she fought with Annette, she thanks Leon for his bravery in saving her from being shot and patches up his bullet wound. She also shares with him her discovery of John's fate, and asks that they get out of here.</p><p>The two continue through the sewers until locating a tram, which takes them toward an abandoned Umbrella factory. There they encounter another tram, only this one stays motionless on a platform that descends down to Umbrella' secret laboratory. However as it descends, William Birkin attacks the two. He first strikes through the tram's wall, managing to graze Ada and knocking her out. Leon then heads outside and does battle with William and is once more able to defeat him.</p><p>Returning to the tram Ada has awoken, although the tram has stopped midway and hasn't managed to reach the lab. Leon suggests that Ada should stay and rest while he looks for a way to kickstart the tram. After climbing through the vents, however, the tram inconveniently begins to work and continues its descent with Ada still inside. With no other alternative but to make his way down, Leon is able to restore power to the area and the nearby elevator, and use it to reach the lab. Noticing the tram, Leon enters but finds that Ada has disappeared.</p><p>Leon will eventually come into contact with Annette Birkin, who while holding him at gunpoint states that Ada is in fact a spy and is trying to acquire the G-Virus. Leon doesn't believe her, though Annette doesn't seem to care either way as she then prepares to kill him. Just before she pulls the trigger, the T-103 tyrant arrives on the scene, forcing Annette to run away. Leon is able to once again deal enough damage to temporarily down the creature, and tries to find Ada.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666457-resident_evil_2_%28u%29_%28v1.1%29_snap0101.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666457\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666457-resident_evil_2_%28u%29_%28v1.1%29_snap0101.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666457\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666457-resident_evil_2_%28u%29_%28v1.1%29_snap0101.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666457-resident_evil_2_%28u%29_%28v1.1%29_snap0101.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Ada &amp; Leon's embrace</figcaption></figure><p>Heading towards the power room, Leon is again ambushed by the T-103 tyrant. Only this time Ada arrives for assistance and tries to gain its attention to save Leon. The tyrant does so and grabs her; Ada manages to shoot it in the face, however, forcing it to toss Ada away at a large machine console before it accidentally falls into a vat of molten liquid below.</p><p>The collision between Ada and the machine dealt enough damage that it instigated the self-destruct sequence. Leon rushes to Ada, who appears to be dying, and the two share an intimate kiss before she bleeds out.</p><p>Leon soon receives a radio call from Claire, asking him to retrieve Sherry from the receptionist office. He does so, and takes the elevator down to the emergency escape train, which has become accessible due to the self-destruct sequence. He lets Sherry rest on the tram and then heads back out to turn on the power. Upon doing so, however, the T-103 tyrant arrives, having gone through a severe mutation that has given it two large claws and made to be much more aggressive. The battle occurs in the midst of a five minute timer, with Leon just barely able to defend himself until a silhouette of what looks to be Ada drops him a rocket launcher.</p><p>Leon picks up the rocket launcher and fires it at the tyrant, destroying it completely. Making his return to the train now that it is powered, he turns on the train. As it begins to pick up speed, Claire arrives and jumps onto the train just in the nick of time. She quickly administers a cure for Sherry, who was infected by William, which appears to take effect and heal her. With the ordeal behind them, Leon heads to the driver's compartment and says his goodbye to Ada.</p><p>However the train quickly rumbles as an alarm sounds. Leon heads back to Claire and Sherry asking what's going on, and heads to investigate the other compartments. Reaching the very end of the train, William Birkin--now an amorphous blob--pours onto the train and slowly slithers towards Leon. With the door locked behind him as a precautionary measure put into effect by the train, Leon is forced to unload everything he has into the monster. After enough punishment it begins to disintegrate, as the door also conveniently unlocks behind Leon.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666468-2189920-william_birkin_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666468\" data-ratio=\"0.63821138211382\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666468-2189920-william_birkin_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666468\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666468-2189920-william_birkin_10.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666468-2189920-william_birkin_10.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>William Birkin's final form</figcaption></figure><p>While on his way to return to Claire, William Birkin strikes back into action, forcing all three characters to split-up. Claire is left hanging off the bottom of the train, Leon crawls across the top, and Sherry rushes to the driver's compartment. Leon is then able to reach the driver's compartment and tell Sherry to turn on the emergency brake. She does so, allowing the three to reunite and quickly run out of the tunnel before the train self-destructs.</p><p>With the nightmare finally over with, the three rest their weary legs. But only before Claire rises up again and states that she still has to find her brother Chris.</p><h4>Epilogue</h4><p>As first detailed in Claire's unlockable epilogue file in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Leon opposes Claire's idea to quickly rush into action so soon to find her brother. Insulted that she opts to abandon them for the sake of her brother, Leon tells her to go and that they [Leon &amp; Sherry] don't need her help. Claire understands that they require medical attention, yet sets out anyway, while promising that she'll return one day.</p><h3>Alternate Scenarios</h3><p>While Claire A &amp; Leon B is the canon ordering, players can still alternatively play through the opposite sequence, where Leon in fact heads through the entrance and Claire enters from the back. This then switched certain character roles, such as Claire coming into conflict with the T-103 Tyrant, and Leon encountering the characters of Robert Kendo and Marvin Branagh. Though the results are the same, there are certain character fates that differ slightly during this ordering of the Scenarios:</p><h4>Leon A</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666476-re2+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666476\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2666476-re2+%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2666476\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666476-re2+%281%29.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2666476-re2+%281%29.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Leon upon first entering the Raccoon Police Station during his A Scenario </figcaption></figure><ul><li>Leon first reunites with Claire in the STARS office.</li><li>Ben Bertolucci dies by being infected with a parasitic larvae that bursts out of his chest.</li><li>Leon will alert Claire that the underground carpark and jail department is now accessible.</li><li>Ada is left to rest in the receptionist office much like Sherry was.</li><li>After learning of her true nature, Ada Wong holds Leon at gunpoint and demands he hand over the G-Virus vial he collected from Annette.

However they often tend to make a breathy growl of sorts, that along with the squishy noise of their movements makes them easy to pick up should one be close by.</p><p>A licker usually takes between 2-3 shotgun or crossbow attacks to kill one. Though because of their lack of sight, players can potentially avoid encounters with one should they walk past rather than run. However if a player gets close enough, a Licker will always catch on to their presence and give chase regardless of their movement speed. While they can sometimes be encountered alone, they will more often than not be found in groups of at least two.</p><p>Their attacks often involve their claws; they will swipe the player's leg when close, and when encountered at a distance will give off a loud shriek and then leap through the air in an attempt to maul the player. They will alternatively strike with their tongue and attempt to strangle the player; if the player's health is in the Caution state, there's a high chance the Licker will rip off the player's head completely.</p><h3>Evolved Licker</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633832-dsc_enemies-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633832\" data-ratio=\"0.78412698412698\" data-width=\"315\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 315px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633832-dsc_enemies-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633832\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633832-dsc_enemies-7.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633832-dsc_enemies-7.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>This is a tougher variant of the Licker that'll be encountered later in the game.

Though while significantly smaller in size, they are still quite resistant to most forms of damage. However they are terribly weak against fire. They primarily attack by spewing a gob of acid at the player from their gaping mouth, though they especially dangerous up close as they will grapple and trap the player with their vines while pouring their acid all over them.</p><p>There is another variant of the creature that's acid will also poison the player should it hit. They are otherwise the same, and are visually distinctive by their 'head' being of a red color as opposed to green.</p><h3>Giant Moth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633838-giant_moth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633838\" data-ratio=\"1.4157650695518\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633838-giant_moth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633838\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633838-giant_moth.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633838-giant_moth.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>While there is only one to be found in the game, the giant moth isn't technically a boss battle. It is encountered within an Umbrella lab and has grown itself a nest. It attacks the player by charging towards them, or spitting poison. While it still has its wings, it is not strong enough to fly very efficiently and can only hover. It is nonetheless quite sturdy and requires around 4 shots from an upgraded desert eagle magnum to down.</p><p>It's also worth noting that it is completely optional to fight, and is only necessary should players desire to register their handprint to access the locked laboratory door.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>G</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633899-gvirus_mutation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633899\" data-ratio=\"0.98901098901099\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633899-gvirus_mutation.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633899\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633899-gvirus_mutation.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633899-gvirus_mutation.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>The first boss encountered in Scenario A, G was once a small parasitic larvae that was implanted by the mutated William Birkin into either Ben Bertolucci or Brian Irons, depending on which character's story it is. After an allotted time, however, it grows into a much larger, more humanoid creature.</p><p>It is slow in speed, so its primary source of attack is to vomit out several small larvae to then seek out the player and attempt to force themselves down their throat. Otherwise it can punch the character when close enough, but the primary tactic is to keep a good distance and keep shooting at it, while also trying to shoot any of the swarming larvae on the ground. After enough damage it will ultimately disintegrate.</p><h3>Giant Alligator</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633849-re2_alligator.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633849\" data-ratio=\"0.63821138211382\" data-width=\"246\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 246px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633849-re2_alligator.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633849\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633849-re2_alligator.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633849-re2_alligator.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>This aptly titled boss is encountered in the sewers. It will surprise attack the player from beneath the sewage water and slowly makes its way through the tunnel; its size means it is impossible to run past it. There are two methods to killing it: first is the basic path of simply unloading whatever the player has into the creature; alternatively the player could drop the gas canister that resides within the middle of the tunnel, and then shoot it once the alligator picks it up with its mouth killing it instantly. If players choose to kill it the old fashioned way, there will be a small stash of ammunition awaiting them next to the tram later in the game.</p><p>The alligator will always be fought in Scenario A, however if it is killed via the gas canister it will stay dead for the alternate character's Scenario B. Otherwise it must be fought again in much the same way, complete with the gas canister still available; it will also visually be shown wounded to account for the previous battle.</p><h3>T-103 'Mr. X'</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2625818-20100430232542%21tyrant_t-103.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2625818\" data-ratio=\"2\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:200.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2625818-20100430232542%21tyrant_t-103.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2625818\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2625818-20100430232542%21tyrant_t-103.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2625818-20100430232542%21tyrant_t-103.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>A mass-produced successor to the T-102 from Resident Evil, the T-103 is only encountered during Scenario B. It is encountered multiple times throughout at scripted moments in the story, often bursting through walls or ambushing from around a corner. A clear way to note if it is about to arrive is if the theme music for the area has stopped.</p><p>It is usually designed to block the player from progressing, forcing them to kill it before it reaches them. Though it will always walk, and when attacked with a powerful enough weapon such as a shotgun will slow down even further. If it gets close its attacks will do a noticeable amount of damage and can potentially kill the player with only about 4 attacks. It will only use its fists to attack, usually using a hook punch to knock the player back as a method of again forcing players to fight it. Though it will also sometimes do an overhead smash with both hands clasped together -- its most powerful attack.</p><p>After enough damage has been dealt it will begin to slightly sway before toppling to the floor. Searching its body afterwards will gift the player some ammunition.</p><h3>T-103 Mutated Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633856-re2-super-tyrant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633856\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633856-re2-super-tyrant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633856\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633856-re2-super-tyrant.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633856-re2-super-tyrant.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Upon inadvertently falling into a vat of molten liquid, the tyrant will re-emerge now mutated and of a completely different boss design. It is only fought once nearing the end, again only during Scenario B, shortly after the player is powering up the escape train. Its trademark jacket has now completely burnt away, revealing a growth in mass, as has its hands formed into large claws.</p><p>It is now considerably faster and will frequently rush and slash at the player. Its attacks are thusly difficult to avoid, likely forcing most players to simply brute force their way through the fight and hope they have enough healing supplies. Upon enough damage, from around 4-5 upgraded magnum shots for reference, a silhouette of Ada Wong will arrive to drop the player--as either Leon or Claire--a rocket launcher.</p><p>The player must then quickly rush and equip it, and then fire at the tyrant -- one shot is all it will take to destroy it.</p><h3>William Birkin First Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633859-willbirkinfirstform.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633859\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633859-willbirkinfirstform.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633859\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633859-willbirkinfirstform.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633859-willbirkinfirstform.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Upon injecting himself with the G-virus, William Birkin has now transformed into a horrible monstrosity -- one that grows more hideous as the game progresses. Similar to the T-103 he is thusly fought multiple times throughout the game, though each time is a different form, and unlike the T-103 is fought across both Scenarios. Though his first is only fought during Scenario B, in place of where players faced 'G' in Scenario A.</p><p>His first form is his most comparatively mundane, as he still retains many of his human physical qualities. Though he still has access to incredible strength, and will pull off a nearby pipe which will govern his attacks. He is slow moving, similar to G, and will primarily swing the pipe around randomly -- any attack that hits does a significant amount of damage, however. Similar to G, the primary strategy is to keep at a distance and fire whatever the player has. He can withstand a fair amount of damage, roughly taking about eight grenade rounds. Once enough damage has been inflicted, the boss theme will cut off and he will then seemingly accidentally fall over the edge into the sewers below.</p><h3>William Birkin Second Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633860-re2-g2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633860\" data-ratio=\"1.4363636363636\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633860-re2-g2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633860\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633860-re2-g2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633860-re2-g2.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>This form is the point where Birkin now literally begins to shed his human qualities in favor of something more monstrous, and is the first William boss for Scenario A. After discarding his pipe, his right arm has grown into an enormous claw, now making him somewhat resemble a tyrant.</p><p>The battleground is set on a tram platform descending down into Umbrella's underground laboratory. Birkin still only walks, but the arena is of a U shape, with the possibility of the player finding themselves at a dead end. Though area is also wide enough that players should be able to potentially rush past.</p><p>Birkin of course now attacks with his claw, which has a slightly greater reach than the pipe but roughly does the same amount of damage. He will also take about the same amount of damage to down as before, so as long as players again keep their distance he will eventually begin bleeding and ultimately slump to the floor after receiving enough damage.</p><h3>William Birkin Third Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633862-re2-g3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633862\" data-ratio=\"1.2923076923077\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633862-re2-g3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633862\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633862-re2-g3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633862-re2-g3.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>At this point William now resembles something more demonic than human, and has access to two equally large claws protruding from his shoulders along with what is now another pair of claws that were once his hands. This form is fought in the B Scenario on the same tram platform as his previous form was fought.</p><p>He still only walks but each step will now cover more distance, allowing him to more quickly catch up to the player. His attacks also now have a much larger reach than before, and he will periodically enter a stance with all four of his claws raised up. If attacked amidst this stance he will unleash a powerful combo with all four claws and can potentially kill the player outright with this attack. If he isn't able to strike the player with this attack, after so long he will revert back to his default stance</p><p>This form is naturally tougher than the last and can withstand even more damage. Though this time when the battle is over Birkin will leap away onto the wall rather than pass out.</p><h3>William Birkin Fourth Form</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633863-re2-g4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633863\" data-ratio=\"0.78666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633863-re2-g4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633863\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633863-re2-g4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633863-re2-g4.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>The final boss of Scenario A, Birkin has how transformed into some sort of monstrous canine.

It won't kill the player outright but still does a high amount of damage.</p><p>The arena offers two tall series of tubes, to which Birkin will occasionally jump onto, potentially allowing players some temporary safety and to get in some extra shots.

One week later, Biohazard 2 would be released in Japan. The content was spread across two discs and featured considerable improvements to the mechanics and graphics from the preceding <a href=\"/resident-evil/3030-5842\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil</a> (see \"Gameplay\" section above).</p><p>Supposedly, the Japanese release was considerably easier than its North American counterpart, featuring different item placement, better firepower and auto-aim enabled by default. Additionally, the Japanese version did not include scenes of player characters being eaten by zombies after death and gore was diminished along with some violent depictions.</p><h3>Resident Evil 2: DualShock Version (Sony PlayStation)</h3><p>Virtually the same as the original PlayStation version, but with added functionality to accept the <a href=\"/dualshock-controller/3000-1\" data-ref-id=\"3000-1\">DualShock Controller</a> released after the game's original release date. The game featured vibration functions and analog controls. This release also saw the addition of Extreme Battle, an unlockable mini game where the player needs to reach the police station and find four anti-biohazard bombs. Also, a cheat code for unlimited ammo was added.</p><p>The Japanese DualShock version featured a \"USA Version\" mode, bringing the difficulty up to par with its overseas counterpart; this release also had feature parity with the North American version and sported the same add-ons and DualShock-only functions. The violence scenarios and gore, however, still remained censored, edited or omitted.</p><p>In 2009, the DualShock Version was released on the <a href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88\" data-ref-id=\"3045-88\">PlayStation Store</a> at a $5.99 price point and is compatible with both the PlayStation 3 and PSP.</p><h3>Resident Evil 2 Platinum (Windows '98 <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>)</h3><p>Contained the same content as the PlayStation releases, except the Dualshock Version's mini games were unlocked from the start. The game was spread across two CD-ROMs.</p><h3>Resident Evil 2 (<a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64</a>)</h3><p>After commercial success on the PlayStation, Capcom commissioned <a href=\"/angel-studios/3010-1195\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1195\">Angel Studios</a> (later renamed to <a href=\"/rockstar-san-diego/3010-3339\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3339\">Rockstar San Diego</a>) to create an Nintendo 64 port. The PlayStation original, however, had over 700MB of data spread across its two discs and the highest capacity for a Nintendo 64 cartridge was a comparatively tiny 64MB (512 Mbit). Despite the software media limitations, the N64 port was comparable to the PlayStation version with the omission of the DualShock Version's Extreme Battle mini game. This version also added additional documents called EX files, which referenced numerous plot details and <a href=\"/resident-evil-zero/3030-10247\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10247\">Resident Evil Zero</a>, which at that time was still in development for the N64 before being moved over to the GameCube later on.</p><p>Thanks to the Nintendo 64's additional 4MB of RAM added by the (optional) Expansion Pak, the game displayed at a higher resolution at times, switching between 640x480 and 320x240 (the PlayStation version's native resolution) depending on how many enemies were in the area. If the player defeated the enemies, then the game would automatically switch to the higher resolution. Without the Expansion Pak, the game's visuals closely resembled the PlayStation original.</p><p>Audio from this version suffered the most compression despite the addition of surround sound (which was absent from previous releases). All content fit on one cartridge and did not force players to switch between two different pieces of media.</p><h3>Biohazard 2 Value Plus (<a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Sega Dreamcast</a>)</h3><p>The Value Plus version is a Japanese-exclusive release that came out one year after the DualShock version and in the same year as the PC and N64 ports. It was bundled with a disc containing a demo of <a href=\"/resident-evil-code-veronica/3030-13940\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13940\">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> and assorted music from various games in the series. Since the Dreamcast ran on a Windows CE operating system, this version of Resident Evil 2 was identical to the PC release (see above). However, if the player had a <a href=\"/vmu-support/3015-6194\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6194\">VMU</a>, they could see their character's health on the display.</p><h3>Resident Evil 2 (Sega Dreamcast)</h3><p>Resident Evil 2 on Dreamcast in territories other than Japan is a two-GD ROM set with each disc being a campaign for the two characters, similar to the original PlayStation edition. The Dreamcast version is known for having no drops in the game's framerate and having higher resolution backgrounds than the Playstation, Nintendo 64 and GameCube versions. It also had an \"Extra\" option in the main menu that allowed the player to view concept art and in-game cutscenes. Like the Japanese version, if the player had a VMU, they were able to see their character's health status on the <a href=\"/vmu-support/3015-6194\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6194\">VMU</a> screen.</p><h3>Biohazard 2 PC (Windows XP PC)</h3><p>The same as the PC version released in 1998, except now compatible with Windows XP machines and on one DVD-ROM with uncompressed 640x480 CG scenes. This particular version is a Japanese exclusive released in 2006. It's often referred to as BioHazard 2 SourceNext, after after the company responsible for re-releasing this version</p><h3>Resident Evil 2 (<a href=\"/gamecube/3045-23\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">Nintendo Gamecube</a>)</h3><p>Some note this as the definitive version of Resident Evil 2, and while it does not feature any of the EX files on N64, it comes complete with the <em>Extreme</em> <i>Battle </i>minigame. Although it did sport slightly better graphics, background resolutions were worse than the Dreamcast and PC versions. Minor differences such as the voice on the main menu are present. All content is available on one disc.</p><p>Along with the release of <a href=\"/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5587\">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a> on the Gamecube, this particular version is considered a rarity for the system because of low print run.</p><h2>Development</h2><h3>Resident Evil 1.5</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633616-51527784am6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633616\" data-ratio=\"0.76775956284153\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633616-51527784am6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633616\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633616-51527784am6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633616-51527784am6.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Image of Elza equipped with a shotgun</figcaption></figure><p>After the launch of Resident Evil, work immediately began on Resident Evil 2 and was scheduled for a 1997 release. Nearing the end of development, when the game was about 80-90% done, the creators felt the sequel was more of the same and was scrapped. The previous version of the game had a female protagonist named Elza Walker who was eventually replaced by Claire Redfield. She shared many of Claire\u2019s traits such as being an avid fan of <a href=\"/motorcycle/3055-366\" data-ref-id=\"3055-366\">motorbikes</a> and was a student. While Claire is the sister of the Chris Redfield, the Resident Evil 1.5 protagonist, Elza, was completely unrelated to any previous Resident Evil character. Leon Kennedy also had a radically different appearance initially, but that too was altered since Capcom believed it held too strong a resemblance to former Resident Evil hero <a href=\"/chris-redfield/3005-413\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris Redfield</a>. Additionally, the policeman named Marvin who dies early on in Resident Evil 2 had a much bigger role in this incarnation; supposedly he would help the player escape the city similar to the role of <a href=\"/barry-burton/3005-987\" data-ref-id=\"3005-987\">Barry</a> in Resident Evil 3.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633617-residentevil2halloweent.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633617\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2633617-residentevil2halloweent.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2633617\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633617-residentevil2halloweent.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2633617-residentevil2halloweent.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Ada in her original researcher outfit</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the design and layout of the police department was modern and resembled a typical police structure. It lacked the gothic elements of the final police station and used the color gray quite frequently; perhaps in a bid to make the area feel sterile.

While there are rogue security bots and aliens later in the game, neither are as prominent as fire. The player must navigate the burning structure, sometimes moving underwater and even zero gravity, using their jetpack to move through the area and using an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-739\" href=\"/arm-cannon/3015-739\" slug=\"arm-cannon\">arm-cannon</a> to extinguish flames. The player must do this quickly, as a limit meter slowly rises the more fire there is. As the meter hits certain amounts like 50%, the area will explode around the player, giving them just seconds to react. A chime is played just before an explosion triggers, if the player is quick and jumps, they will do a backflip and avoid the explosion. If the player is lost at any point in the game, they can press the Z button, where the Team Navigator, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11982\" href=\"/chris-partn/3005-11982\" slug=\"chris-partn\">Chris</a>,\u00a0will give them directions on where to go.\u00a0At the end of the level, they face a boss which require a certain strategy to defeat. The player is given their score, with a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2163\" href=\"/ranking-system/3015-2163\" slug=\"ranking-system\">rank</a> ranging from F to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2962\" href=\"/s-rank/3015-2962\" slug=\"s-rank\">S</a> depending on their time, amount of survivors rescued and what the limit meter was at various points in the level.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Extinguishing fires earns the player crystals. Crystals have two uses: Similar to rings in\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3025-383\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3025-383\" slug=\"sonic-the-hedgehog\">Sonic The Hedgehog</a>, these crystals protect the player from death. As long as the player has at least one crystal, they will be protected. Like the\u00a0aforementioned\u00a0game, contact with fire will cause the player's crystals to fly out from them, but can be recollected if the player is quick enough. If the player is burned without a crystal in their possession, they will die and lose a life, sending them back to the last checkpoint. The second use of the crystals is to rescue survivors from danger. Each survivor requires a certain amount of crystals in order to teleport them out of the building, if the player uses more crystals than the required amount they will earn additional lives. At the end of the mission, the player may\u00a0receive\u00a0fan-mail from survivors they have rescued. If the player manages to find and rescue a cameo member of the development team, they will\u00a0receive\u00a0a password to unlock some of the game's extras.<br/>\u00a0<br/>On completion of the game, the player unlocks a random level generator. In this mode, levels are generated randomly, adding to the game's longetivity.<br/><h2>Story</h2><h3>Mission 1: Fallen Memory</h3><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6036/212543-br8.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212543\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.63636363636364\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6036/212543-br8.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212543\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6036/212543-br8.png\"/></a><figcaption>Mission 1 establishes the game's mechanics.</figcaption></figure>     The first mission takes place at a power plant, where fires have broken out due to a breach of the core reactor, trapping researchers and\u00a0personnel\u00a0inside.

The rookie sets off to find another escape pod when they stumble upon another transmitter.

With communications to the Burning Ship still blocked, they must employ the help from the mysterious voice to navigate the strange structure. When they manage to find and destroy the source of the magnetic shield, the mysterious voice reveals herself to be Iria Klein. At the age of 16, she developed an incurable desease, so her father put her into cryogenic statis aboard the space ship and programmed it to orbit around Earth, until a desease could be found. In order to protect her, he cloned his conciousness into the spaceship's main computer memory banks. After a while however, the computers artificial intelligence started to malfunction, obsorbing all floating material in space it came into contact with, creating a large shield. When the ship receieved a transmission that a cure had been found, it began carrying out it's final instructions to land back on earth. With it's vastly increased mass however, this would act a meteor on a collision with Earth. With it's outer shield nearly invincible, the only way to stop it is to destroy the main computer.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2579/1659649-00000008.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659649\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.63636363636364\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2579/1659649-00000008.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659649\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2579/1659649-00000008.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2579/1659649-00000008.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Tillis faces the corrupt AI.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     With the magnetic shield disabled, the Burning Man is able to enter the space ship and make contact with the rookie, transporting them onto the vessel.

They must work to accomplish the objective at hand, which is determined by the game mode they have chosen.</p><h3>Arenas</h3><p>Arenas are Monkey Smash Arena's one through three.

The main complaint was that the game presented too many things to collect and that it was simply too long.</p><p>However, many praised the amazing graphics which were generated with the help of the expansion pack.

The game also has a hub area where you start, from which you can enter one of the four themed areas. These themed areas consist of a few stages each and all end with an epic boss confrontation. The goal of the game is to finally beat all four of those bosses in order to finally come face to face with the Black Jewel, a seemingly cursed object which spawned monsters all around Wario's newly built castle. <br/><br/>The game is very combat oriented, with small puzzle areas reachable by going through trap doors supplying most of the mental challenge. These areas are necessary in order to finish the level, as you need 4 gems which can only be obtained by successfully finishing the puzzles. The game also has a unique approach to death. When Wario runs out of health, you can simply pay a large sum of gold acquired through playing the game to revive yourself. <br/><br/>The game received overall decent reviews, but it's primary criticism was it's lack of variety and short length.

Instead of beginning your adventure as Mario, <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a> is the first character you are able to play, who has woken up from his deep slumber. There is also a small event before you enter the castle in which you have to capture a rabbit with a key to the front door. Yoshi sets off into the castle in search of his friends, and you will soon be able to play as all four characters. Much of the rest of the main game is almost exactly like its predecessor, jumping into paintings, finding stars and defeating <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/194865-super_mario_64_ds__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194865\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/194865-super_mario_64_ds__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194865\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/194865-super_mario_64_ds__2_.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Mario inflated</figcaption></figure><p>The control scheme was a big issue as it used to be played using a analogue stick on the N64, which does not exist on the DS. Nintendo came up with a solution of using the touch screen as an analog stick. The controls can be changed to suit both right and left-handed play styles. During gameplay, pressing select will immediately bring up the \"Control Modes\" screen which provide the three following options.</p><h4>Standard Mode</h4><p>This mode uses the D-pad for movement. Holding Y will cause the character to dash. You can also perform a charge dash by holding Y, then pressing a direction on the D-pad will cause the player character to move immediately in the desired direction.</p><h4>Touch Mode</h4><p>The original Nintendo DS models came with a wrist strap with a thumb piece used to simulate analog control on the touch screen. A circle will appear on the touch screen indicating the speed the player character will move in. The circle will move if you try to slide off of the circle's radius. Letting go allows you to set a new neutral point on the touch screen controls.</p><h4>Dual-Hand Mode</h4><p>This mode allows for the use of a stylus for analog control. A bigger circle will appear on the touch screen which indicates the player's speed. It functions similarly to how the circle behaves in Touch Mode, however you can also use the D-pad for functions similar to the face buttons. This is suited for those who use the NIntendo DS on a flat system.</p><p>Throughout the castle grounds you'll often notice small bunnies hopping around wildly. Though they may seem just for decoration, they're actually a small challenge for you. Each rabbit you catch unlocks a new mini-game in Princess Peach's Rec Room. Each of the four characters has seven rabbits to catch\u2014below is a list of their locations. The easiest way to catch the rabbits is to chase them into a corner and dive at them. They always run in a pattern, giving you a chance to predict where they go next.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Yoshi</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/791469-920758_20041007_screen009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791469\" data-ratio=\"1.4742647058824\" data-width=\"272\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/791469-920758_20041007_screen009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791469\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14097/791469-920758_20041007_screen009.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14097/791469-920758_20041007_screen009.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Yoshi in Dry Dry Desert.</figcaption></figure><p>You begin the game as <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\"> Yoshi</a>, and until you collect eight stars total he's the only character you can play as. Yoshi has a few unique abilities, including his \"floaty\" jump. If you jump and hold down the jump button in mid-air, Yoshi's legs will flutter underneath him, letting him float a little further than normal. Also, Yoshi can fire eggs as projectiles. To lay an egg you'll have to first grab an enemy with Yoshi's tongue and then press the crouch button. These eggs will ricochet off of multiple enemies if you line 'em up right, too!</p><p>The unique ability that lets Yoshi solve puzzles others can't is his ability to breathe fire. Break open a red \"?\" block and grab the power flower to Yoshi fire breath for a short period of time. His fire breath can be used to melt ice blocks, or to damage enemies.</p><p>He's also the only character that does not fight with his fists, therefore he is unable to fight ghosts, which also means you cannot enter Big Boo's Haunt as Yoshi.</p><p><b>How to Unlock: </b></p><p>You don't need to unlock Yoshi\u2014he's available at the very start of the game!</p><h3>Mario</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1851/203846-dm64_comparison.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203846\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.55389221556886\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1851/203846-dm64_comparison.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203846\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1851/203846-dm64_comparison.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1851/203846-dm64_comparison.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Graphical comparison between SM64DS (left), and SM64 (right)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/mario/3005-177\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"> Mario</a></p><p>is probably the most versatile character in the game, though Luigi runs a close second. Mario is very maneuverable and quick, and his most unique ability is his wall kick. Only Mario can jump off of walls to gain extra height, which will let you reach certain areas that other characters can't (or just take shortcuts that are beyond the reach of others).</p><p>When Mario grabs a power flower he'll inflate and float around. You can change Mario's altitude by rapidly tapping the jump button, letting Mario reach vertical platforms that are out of reach to others. Also, some red \"?\" boxes will give Mario a feather instead of a power flower. With this feather, Mario can glide through the air to reach new areas. You can start flying either by shooting out of a cannon or by performing a triple jump.</p><p><strong>How to Unlock:</strong></p><p>You first need eight power stars before you can unlock Mario. When you've got the first eight, go to the</p><p><em>Goomboss Battle</em></p><p>behind Princess Peach's room and defeat the Goomboss.</p><h3>Luigi</h3><p><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\"> Luigi</a>'s greatest strength is in his jumps. Like Yoshi, Luigi can sort of hover in mid-air for a second by holding the jump button. More importantly, Luigi has a very unique back flip technique. Luigi's back flip goes higher than anyone else's, and as Luigi falls from his back flip he slowly twirls down to the ground. You can use this back flip to reach high places, <em>or</em> to glide across large gaps that other characters can't jump across. To perform a back flip, just jump while crouching.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/10599-luigi_mp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10599\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2016129032258\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/10599-luigi_mp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10599\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/31/10599-luigi_mp.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/31/10599-luigi_mp.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Luigi </figcaption></figure><p>Have Luigi grab a power flower and he'll turn invisible. While invisible, Luigi has the special ability to pass through certain objects, including certain paintings, mirrors, and especially cages. Since the invisibility only lasts a short time, you'll have to be quick to get to your goal once you grab the power flower with Luigi.</p><p><strong>How to Unlock:</strong></p><p>Once you've collected the first eight power stars you can then access the</p><p><em>Big Boo's Haunt</em></p><p>course in the basement.

He's slower than everyone else, has shorter jumps, and is generally less wieldy. However, what he lacks in maneuverability he more than makes up for in raw power. Wario's strength is unique, and he's the only character in the game that is capable of busting open the black-brick blocks that are located in some of the courses.</p><p>Wario's special power flower ability will turn him into a giant hunk of metal. When Wario is in metal form he's nearly immovable\u2014strong winds won't be able to push him from cliffs, and even powerful water currents can't budge him. You can use this unique ability to get Wario into places that other characters just can't reach.</p><p><strong>How to Unlock:</strong> You won't be able to unlock Wario until after you've collected thirty power stars. When you unlock the second floor of the castle, head up there with Luigi. Grab the power flower in a nearby room and jump through the mirror to hop into the painting of Wario and complete the <em>Chief Chilly Challenge</em>.</p><h2>Recreational Room (Mini Games)</h2><p>In addition to the main game, Super Mario 64 DS also has a mini-game mode that utilizes much of the touch screen controls. Divided into four sections representing the four characters, each section hosts a different variety of mini-games. Yoshi's mini-games include Wanted, a game where you have to find a character in a sea of impostors, and a Luigi's Mansion mini-game with the objective of using your stylus as a flashlight to detect a <a href=\"/boo/3005-943\" data-ref-id=\"3005-943\">Boo</a>, among others. Mario's mini-games include a couple platforming-jumping games with the objective to squash the <a href=\"/shy-guy/3005-940\" data-ref-id=\"3005-940\">Shy Guys</a> and prevent Mario from falling, a couple of puzzle mini-games where you have to draw the path of a falling Mario head to keep it away from the piranha plants, and a turtle shell-bowling game with the objective to get as many points as possible. Luigi's mini-game section includes many casino-style gambling games like roulette and memory. Wario's mini-games include a missile-command style bomb-omb game, and a snow-ball game. Several of these games and more are unlockable as you play throughout the game.Several of these minigames were included as extas in <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros/3025-1546\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1546\">New Super Mario Bros</a> when it was released two years later/</p><h2>Versus Mode</h2><p>The last additional feature Super Mario 64 DS has is a versus mode. In this mode, you can compete against your friends in levels such as Princess's Secret Slide, Castle Grounds, Sunshine Isles and Battle Fort. The main objective is to collect as many stars as you can.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>As of March 31 2016, Super Mario 64 DS has sold 11.06 million copies worldwide.</p>", "deck": "A remake of the original Nintendo 64 classic, Super Mario 64 DS adds 30 new stars, three new playable characters and 36 mini-games utilizing the touch screen.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/1839039-box_sm64ds.png", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1839039-box_sm64ds.png", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/1839039-box_sm64ds.png", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/1839039-box_sm64ds.png", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/1839039-box_sm64ds.png", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/1839039-box_sm64ds.png", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/1839039-box_sm64ds.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-64-ds/3030-8942/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-8942/", "number_of_user_reviews": 7, "original_release_date": "2004-11-21 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/", "id": 19, "name": "CERO: All Ages"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-15/", "id": 15, "name": "OFLC: G8+"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/", "id": 7, "name": "PEGI: 3+"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 15:48:23", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/", "abbreviation": "DS", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/", "id": 52, "name": "Nintendo DS"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WIIU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}], "id": 8942, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Super Mario 64 DS"}, "platform": "DS", "title": "Super Mario 64 DS"}

href=\"/dimps-corporation/3010-119\">Dimps</a> -- one for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36\">Nintendo Wii</a>, the other an offshoot title for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-52\" href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>. It brings a distinct new setting to the Sonic series, going after the fantastical rather than realism, and takes inspiration from games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1347\" href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3025-1347\">Mario Galaxy</a> to become an evolution of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\" href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852\">3D Sonic games</a>, as opposed to the throwback to the 2D classics like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28078\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-1/3030-28078\">Sonic 4</a>.</p><p>There are two <i>Sonic Colors</i> games: a full 3D one for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36\">Wii</a>, and a 2D one for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-52\" href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a>, and both were released on November 16, 2010. Sega has stated that if <i>Sonic Colors</i> for Wii sells well enough, they might port the game to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\">Playstation 3</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20\">Xbox 360</a>. However, a version for Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 has yet to be announced, even over a year after <i>Sonic Colors</i> for Wii was released.</p><h2>Sonic Colors for Wii</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403723\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.599609375\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403723\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403723-4701737511_b0a9a7957d_b.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Sonic explores Tropical Resort.</figcaption></figure><p>The Wii game is a spiritual sequel to the ''daytime'' Sonic stages of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20953\" href=\"/sonic-unleashed/3030-20953\">Sonic Unleashed</a>. The stages are in full 3D in which Sonic can run and jump in any direction, periodically changing to a fixed 2D perspective for gameplay along a 2D plane, reminiscent of the original <a data-ref-id=\"3045-6\" href=\"/genesis/3045-6\">Genesis/Megadrive</a> Sonic titles. The 2D part of the stages take up roughly half of the levels, with plenty of vertical level design for platforming. The 3D segments, however, are narrow, and encourage high speed acrobatics.</p><p>But unlike Sonic Unleashed's gameplay, Sonic Colors allows the speedy rodent to collect Wisps, colorful floating aliens that give him special abilities upon flicking the Wii remote. (Unless the player opts out of motion controls and uses a Wii Classic Controller, which the game supports.) These power-ups include abilities such turning into a drill that lets Sonic dig through rock or water, or increasing his speed while he bounces from the walls like a laser. Only one Wisp can be used at a time, and the power-ups have a guage that tell you how long they will last.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403725\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.599609375\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1403725\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/2/27239/1403725-4702369776_3b35f6a132_b.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonic rides the rail in Sweet Mountain Zone.</figcaption></figure><p>The levels are sizable and feature a very large amount of hidden paths and items, mostly accessible only with a specific power-up.

However, like the Wii version, the Wisps also make an appearance and function as powerups, two of which are exclusive to the DS version. Each Wisp can also activate certain stage mechanisms, like igniting a rocket that allows Sonic to fly over a large segment of the stage.</p><p>The bosses from the DS game will not be available on the Wii game, and the Wii bosses will not appear on the DS game. However, the DS levels make a cameo appearance in the backgrounds of the Wii game, while the same goes for the Wii version of the DS levels, giving the impression that each version shows a different view of the same world.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1384178\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2165450121655\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1384178\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/11512/1384178-4640469436_708c23f35c.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Poster for Eggman's amusement park.</figcaption></figure><p>Interested in the native Wisps, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-293\" href=\"/dr-robotnik/3005-293\">Dr. Egggman (aka Robotnik)</a> has pulled their home planets together using a large tractor beam, and converted each planet into a large amusement park.

After the bad receptions of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20584\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-20584\">Sonic 2006</a>, Sonic Unleashed, and Black Knight, they decided to move away from getting the hedgehog to do realistic human things, and go back to the more imaginative and fantastical ideas that fit the character better.</p><blockquote><p><b>\"By adding game elements that didn't fit with Sonic's traditional sense of speed, I think the recent titles in the series have failed to play to Sonic's strengths.\"</b><br />-Takashi Iizuka, producer</p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1459920-sweet_factory___4_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1459920\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.59982638888889\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1459920-sweet_factory___4_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1459920\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1459920-sweet_factory___4_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1459920-sweet_factory___4_.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Sonic Colors (Wii)</figcaption></figure><p>The producer for the game, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-33657\" href=\"/takashi-iizuka/3040-33657\">Takashi Iizuka</a>, began by bringing Sonic to a new, more cartoon-like sense of style, with brighter colors and more imaginative surroundings and characters. Described as a game primarily aimed for kids, the team decided to base each stage on a popular theme park attraction, and then blow it up to fit an entire planet.</p><p>This time they tried to let Sonic do something that made sense to his character, unlike their previous attempts at making him a were-hog or letting him handle a sword. When asked about Sonic, people always come up with speed, but the developers could not find any way to make Sonic's speed a main part of the gameplay, so they came up with a transformation system that gave him moves that fit with the nature of speed, like allowing him to pass through walls of rock or run over water. They made sure for those powerups to remain a temporary transformation so that they do not dominate the gameplay, and keep Sonic always in motion with his traditional abilities.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1421710\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1421710\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/8/80248/1421710-sonic_colors_32_noscale.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Drilling on a 2D segment.</figcaption></figure><p>While <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28078\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-1/3030-28078\">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a> is meant for the Sonic crowd that prefers the older games, this game is made for the audience that prefers the 3D games.

The game was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-781\" href=\"/sonic-team/3010-781\">Sonic Team</a> and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62\">Sega</a> for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC. The game was originally released to kick off the 15th anniversary for the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. As part of this celebration, the Xbox version (for a short while) shipped with a DVD containing the first five episodes of Sonic X. The game was released on February 21, 2006. Sonic Riders even had an Archie Comics adaptation of the game.</p><p>The game's reception was relatively mediocre. Reviews ranged from eights to fives. Game Rankings lists the GameCube version as the highest rated with a 63.1% rating, then the PlayStation 2 version with 59.7%, the Xbox version with 59%, and last the PC version with 43.3%.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Sonic Riders is a traditional racing game in the same vein as <a data-ref-id=\"3025-180\" href=\"/f-zero/3025-180\">F-Zero</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-205\" href=\"/wipeout/3025-205\">Wipeout</a>. Players can choose a character, each with different stats that slightly alter their performance during the game. In addition, the player can select a board or even other vehicles to use as they are unlocked, and each affects the performance of the character during the race. There are a total of fourteen tracks to race on, seven of which must be unlocked through the game's story mode, and two that must be unlocked by winning Gold in the World Grand Prix. The key feature of the game is a small air gauge in the corner of the screen. Air is essentially the fuel for the Extreme Gear, and is depleted slowly as the race goes on. Air is also depleted when the player performs certain maneuvers, such as boosting. Air can be gained at some stations along the way (when out of air, the character runs along the track slowly while carrying their board), as well as by doing well in tricks. Rings on the track \"level up\" the player, allowing them to carry more air (at the start of each race, the player is restarted to Level 1).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/457731-48327_28_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457731\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69965277777778\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/457731-48327_28_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457731\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/0/3699/457731-48327_28_2.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Performing a trick.</figcaption></figure><p>Each character has one of three attributes: Speed, Flight, or Power. The main benefit to these attributes is what it allows the character to do during a race. The Speed attribute allows characters to grind on rails along the track for a good shortcut. The Flight attribute allows characters to \"fly\" over certain portions of the track, triggered by rings. The Power attribute allows characters to destroy obstacles that make shortcuts for the character to go on. Each maneuver for these attributes will refill the air gauge as well. Because most characters' stats are similar, their attribute is a point of interest.</p><p>There are three types of Extreme Gear available in the game: Boards, Skates, and Bikes. Boards are the only gear unlocked at the beginning of the game, and is the all-around gear. The Skates have lower performance, but use up less air, and the Bikes have higher performance, but use up more air. Some characters can only use one of the three types, limiting options.</p><h3>Playable Characters</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16291/494722-chara_jet_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494722\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.1062271062271\" data-width=\"273\" style=\"width: 273px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16291/494722-chara_jet_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494722\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/16291/494722-chara_jet_1_.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/16291/494722-chara_jet_1_.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Jet the Hawk</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Sonic the Hedgehog</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-5697\" href=\"/jet-the-hawk/3005-5697\">Jet the Hawk</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-45\" href=\"/tails/3005-45\">Miles \"Tails\" Prower</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-5781\" href=\"/wave-the-swallow/3005-5781\">Wave the Swallow</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-204\" href=\"/knuckles/3005-204\">Knuckles the Echidna</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-6040\" href=\"/storm-the-albatross/3005-6040\">Storm the Albatross</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-293\" href=\"/dr-eggman/3005-293\">Dr. Eggman</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-948\" href=\"/amy-rose/3005-948\">Amy Rose</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-811\" href=\"/shadow-the-hedgehog/3005-811\">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2366\" href=\"/rouge-the-bat/3005-2366\">Rouge the Bat</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-4691\" href=\"/cream-the-rabbit/3005-4691\">Cream the Rabbit</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-690\" href=\"/aiai/3005-690\">AiAi</a></li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-31\" href=\"/ulala/3005-31\">Ulala</a></li><li>Omochao</li><li>E-10000G</li><li>E-10000R</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-1319\" href=\"/nights/3005-1319\">Nights</a></li><li>Super Sonic</li></ul><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game opens with Sonic and Tails walking in Future City, again searching for the Chaos Emeralds. All of the sudden, Tails's radar goes off and three mysterious riders fly by. Sonic pursues them on foot (as the radar is detecting they are carrying a Chaos Emerald), and knocks one of the three off their board. He quickly catches up to the leader, but is outmaneuvered. The next day, Dr. Eggman announces that he will be hosting a World Grand Prix. The entrance fee is one Chaos Emerald, and the winner \"takes all!\" Sonic recognizes the three riders as a few of the entrants, and decides to enter himself. The race will be on Extreme Gear, a type of hoverboard that the three riders were using. The three riders are later revealed to be the Babylong Rogues, consisting of Jet the Hawk, Wave the Swallow, and Storm the Albatross.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li>Windows 2000/XP</li><li>1GHz Pentium III/AMD Processor</li><li>128MB RAM</li><li>64MB VRAM DirectX 3D Compatible Video Card</li><li>3GB Hard Disk Space</li><li>640x480 16 Bit (High Color) Display</li><li>12X CD ROM Drive</li><li>DirectX 9.0C</li><li>DirectX Sound Card</li><li>RECOMMENDED</li><li>1.4GHz Pentium 4</li><li>256 MB RAM</li><li>640x480 24/32 Bit (True Color) Display</li></ul>", "deck": "Sonic Riders stars Sonic and his friends, and their quest to win in the World Grand Prix.

The game most notably introduced two major characters: <a data-ref-id=\"3005-811\" href=\"/shadow-the-hedgehog/3005-811\">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>, a black hedgehog with upward-curled quills, amnesia problems, and a singular focus on finding out his reason for existence, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2366\" href=\"/rouge-the-bat/3005-2366\">Rouge the Bat</a>, a large-breasted treasure hunter who harbors a healthy obsession with jewels, both of whom appear in more subsequent games than any new character introduced afterward.</p><p>Where Sonic Adventure 2's predecessor was focused on telling a multilayered story with numerous protagonists, this game took a more refined approach; instead of selecting which individual character to play as when starting the adventure, the choice was only between which faction to play, \"Hero\" (featuring <a data-ref-id=\"3005-73\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73\">Sonic</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-45\" href=\"/tails/3005-45\">Tails</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-204\" href=\"/knuckles/3005-204\">Knuckles</a>) or \"Dark\" (featuring Shadow, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-293\" href=\"/dr-eggman/3005-293\">Eggman</a>, and Rouge), and experiencing the same events from the perspective of either set of characters. In terms of gameplay, both sport similar styles (though Dark assumes that the Hero campaign has been completed first, and is noticeably more difficult in comparison); Sonic/Shadow stages focus on running through stages that have been streamlined for speed, Tails/Eggman stages feature their characters piloting mechanical walking units with ballistic/missile capabilities, and Knuckles/Rouge stages deal with their characters flying around enormous stages to find objects (usually shards of the Master Emerald) in groups of three, usually to eclectic and interesting music.</p><p>An additional feature of Sonic Adventure 2 was the inclusion of an improved Chao Garden from the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\" href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852\">Sonic Adventure</a>. After levels, players are able to find Chao Boxes that contain a key to enter Chao World after completing the level. After unlocking Chao World, it can also be accessed from the mission selection screen. After hatching Chao, they can participate in Chao Races and Chao Karate. In order to do well, it is important to raise the Chao's skills. To do so, players can collect Chaos Drives, animals, or feed the Chao fruit. After some time, Chao can evolve to adult forms that depend on what type of character, Hero or Dark, was used to raise it and what stat is the highest.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Hoping to find some sort of weapon, Dr. Eggman unseals his grandfather's greatest invention, Project Shadow, for the first time in 50 years. What he finds instead is a black hedgehog, claiming his name is Shadow. Now free, Shadow promises to grant Doctor Eggman one wish - but first he must meet him at the Space Colony ARK.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611779\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.74857142857143\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611779\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/18205/611779-son2dc002.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>\"I'm outta here!\"</figcaption></figure><p>A week later, Sonic the Hedgehog finds himself on the run from the Military Organization, G.U.N (Guardian Unit of Nations), who claim Sonic is a dangerous criminal. Unaware of what is going on, Sonic attempts to avoid capture when he encounters Shadow the Hedgehog, who is in the middle of stealing a Chaos Emerald. Putting two and two together, Sonic assumes the Military is mistaking Shadow for Sonic (and vice versa), and this \"fake\" Hedgehog is the reason Sonic is in so much trouble. Before Sonic can engage Shadow in battle, however, Shadow vanishes in to thin air using a power called \"Chaos Control\", leaving Sonic surrounded by dozens of fully-armed G.U.N soldiers.</p><h3>Rouge's Report</h3><p>After Sonic Adventure 2 hit retail, SonicTeam published the Official Sonic Adventure 2 Strategy Guide in Japan, which contained \"The Last Report on Project Shadow\", written by the in-game character Rouge the Bat, in an effort to uncover the mystery of who - or what Shadow is, and where he came from. A summary of the report follows:</p><blockquote><p>50 years ago, the current President of Nations contracted Professor Gerald Robotnik to research the possibility of immortality. Gerald initially refused, comparing it to to playing God. But when his niece, Maria Robotnik, contracted the terminal (and as-of-yet incurable) disease NIDS (Neuro-Immuno Deficiency Syndrome), Gerald reconsidered the project as a means to extend her life. The top-secret \"Project Shadow\" (as it became to be known due to the secrecy of the research) took place on the Space Colony known as ARK and began researching the effects of Chaos Emeralds on living tissue.<br /><br />One experiment, designed to accelerate the rate of cell regeneration seen in some species of lizards, turned disastrous - the \"Biolizard\" subject grew ten times its normal size and became violent, nearly killing several scientists before being contained. When Military Organization G.U.N learned of the disaster aboard the ARK, they sprung in to action in order to silence Project Shadow (violently, if necessary). When they arrived aboard the ARK, Professor Gerald was already putting the finishing touches on what he called the \"Ultimate Life-form\", an immortal black hedgehog, named after the project he was born from: Shadow. Not knowing what the military would do with something like Shadow, Gerald entrusted Maria to take him to an escape pod and head down to the planet below.<br /><br />They were intercepted by G.U.N soldiers, who, in an effort to kill Shadow, accidentally shoot Maria. With her last dying breath, she sealed Shadow in the escape pod and ejected him to earth. When Professor Gerald heard the news of his niece's death, he flew in to a rage; the very project he took part in to save her life ended up being the key to her death. Before being captured by G.U.N and sentenced to death for the \"accident\" on ARK, Professor Gerald gave Shadow strict instructions to carry out his revenge for what happened to Maria. Shadow was sealed in stasis to ensure that the truth about what happened on the ARK was never revealed.</p></blockquote><h2>Other Info</h2><p>2 players simultaneous</p><p>Memory blocks needed: <b>11</b></p><p>Game Boy Advance compatible</p><h2>Levels</h2><h3>Hero</h3><ul><li><b>SONIC</b>: City Escape</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Wild Canyon</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Prison Lane</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Metal Harbor</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Green Forest</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Pumpkin Hill</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Mission Street</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Aquatic Mine</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Route 101</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Hidden Base</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Pyramid Cave</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Death Chamber</li><li><b>TAILS</b>: Eternal Engine</li><li><b>KNUCKLES</b>: Meteor Herd</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Crazy Gadget</li><li><b>SONIC</b>: Final Rush</li></ul><h3>Dark</h3><ul><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Iron Gate</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Dry Lagoon</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Sand Ocean</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: Radical Highway</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Egg Quarters</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Lost Colony</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Weapons Bed</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Security Hall</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: White Jungle</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Route 280</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: Sky Rail</li><li><b>ROUGE</b>: Mad Space</li><li><b>EGGMAN</b>: Cosmic Wall</li><li><b>SHADOW</b>: Final Chase</li></ul><h3>Last Story</h3><ul><li><b>ALL</b>: Cannon's Core</li></ul><h3>Unlockable</h3><ul><li><b>SONIC</b>: <a data-ref-id=\"3035-144\" href=\"/green-hill-zone/3035-144\">Green Hill Zone</a></li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p><a data-ref-id=\"3040-38321\" href=\"/jun-senoue/3040-38321\">Jun Senoue</a> returns to lend his unmistakable 80's Hair Band music styles to the game's soundtrack, and he is backed up by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-74739\" href=\"/fumie-kumatani/3040-74739\">Fumie Kumatani</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-54819\" href=\"/kenichi-tokoi/3040-54819\">Kenichi Tokoi</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-40721\" href=\"/tomoya-ohtani/3040-40721\">Tomoya Ohtani</a>.

href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3 </a>was supposed to be a new beginning for the franchise. Originally billed as a reboot for the series, the primary design goal for the game was to create a \"realistic\" Sonic game -- complete with a full-on <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/daynight-cycle/3015-92\" data-ref-id=\"3015-92\">day/night cycle</a>, physics-centric gameplay, and a huge world to explore. The game that ended up on store shelves was radically different: essentially another game broken out of the <a href=\"/sonic-adventure/3030-7852\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\">Sonic Adventure</a> gameplay mold, it contained unaltered game elements and concepts largely dating all the way back to 1999.</p><p>As per the formula established by Sonic Adventure, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) is broken up in to multiple storylines: one for hero <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73\" data-ref-id=\"3005-73\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, another for rival <a href=\"/shadow-the-hedgehog/3005-811\" data-ref-id=\"3005-811\">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>, and a third story for the newcomer <a href=\"/silver-the-hedgehog/3005-1969\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1969\">Silver the Hedgehog</a>. Though each character has their own plot threads, paths frequently cross and storylines intersect. Like <a href=\"/sonic-adventure-2/3030-19060\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19060\">Sonic Adventure 2</a>, each of the three characters' campaigns does not represent just a single playable character, but a team of characters. For example, throughout the course of Sonic's story, one can expect to play portions of certain stages as <a href=\"/tails/3005-45\" data-ref-id=\"3005-45\">Tails</a>, or <a href=\"/knuckles/3005-204\" data-ref-id=\"3005-204\">Knuckles</a>.

A typical scenario involves exploring a Town Stage in order to find a way to access the next Action Stage, and once the level is complete, you're taken back to the Town Stage to repeat the process. Town Stages contain human <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs</a>, which can offer hints on how to find the next Action Stage, or offer side missions to complete for money. A handful of shops exist around the game world's as well, which will sell upgrades that unlock new abilities.</p><p>New to the game is the \"Action Gauge\": a meter that determines how much of a special ability each character can use. When the gauge depletes, the special ability is unavailable until it recharges. For example, Silver the Hedgehog can only use his psychokinesis until the action gauge is empty.</p><p>Although Sonic's action gauge is always on-screen (just as it is for other characters) he possesses no abilities that deplete the action gauge - except for when he is carrying <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/princess-elise/3005-15639\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15639\">Princess Elise</a>, where it's used for a protective shield ability.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219280\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-219280\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/219280-sonic_the_hedgehog_ps3screenshots2769sonic_movie03.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>In Soleanna, the City of Water, its people are holding a celebration marked by the lighting of a giant torch called the \"Sun of Soleanna\".

Shown along side a number of other <a href=\"/tech-demo/3015-2305\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2305\">tech demos </a>Sega created for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console, the \"Hedgehog\" tech demo featured a real-time animated scene of Sonic racing through miles of forest as robots closed in around him. After easily outrunning the robots, Sonic found himself at the ruins of an old castle, where the demonstrator took control to showcase a real-time physics engine. By pressing a button, the demonstrator would throw out a container which would burst on impact, scattering golden rings around the dilapidated environment. The animation resumed, with Sonic being chased out of the castle by the squad of robots who had been hunting him. Now outside, an airship loomed overhead. The ship's cargo doors opened, and hundreds of hunter robots poured out, completely surrounding Sonic on all sides. Having nowhere to escape to, the robots all simultaneously open fire on the blue hedgehog, and the hail of gunfire presumably leaves Sonic for dead. However, from the smoke rose the now-transformed Super Sonic. Super Sonic flies forward at high speed to meet the robot army head on - the tech demo animation ending right before we see the final result.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-752462\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-752462\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/1486/752462-929717_20050908_screen003.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Despite being played exclusively for the press in secret, cell phone video footage of the tech demo reel was leaked on to the internet within hours of being shown. The game was officially announced on September 9th, 2005 <a href=\"/sonic-team/3010-781\" data-ref-id=\"3010-781\">by current President of Sonic Team,</a> <a href=\"../../yuji-naka/72-33662/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yuji Naka</a>, who stated that they would be treating this game as if it were the original <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3030-2465\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\">Sonic the Hedgehog </a>on the Sega Genesis - fully committing themselves to rebooting Sonic's universe. The game was to be a new beginning for the franchise, with particular focus being paid to a specific goal: \"What if Sonic the Hedgehog existed in the real world?\" When officially announced, the same animated scene from the behind-closed-doors demonstration was shown, minus the interactive ring physics demo. Instead, a brief demonstration of the actual game itself was revealed, showing a very early version of the level known as \"Kingdom Valley\". The highlight of the gameplay demonstration was the game's lighting engine, which self-shadowed everything in the environment. This was to fuel the game's day/night cycle , a first for a Sonic title. All of this would be aimed to celebrate Sonic's 15th Anniversary in 2006.</p><p>Not long after that point, Yuji Naka announced his resignation from both Sonic Team and Sega, departing the company after nearly two decades of employment, in order to start an independent studio, <a href=\"/prope-ltd/3010-6481\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6481\">PROPE</a>. Meanwhile, Nintendo chose Sonic Team as one of the very first third party developers to get <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> Development kits - then still codenamed the \"Nintendo Revolution\". Previously, Sega had planned to release Sonic 2006 on all three platforms, expecting the \"Revolution\" to be comparable to the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in terms of technology. When shown the Wii Remote and the level of graphical horsepower in the Wii, Sonic 2006 Game Director <a href=\"/yojiro-ogawa/3040-40732\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40732\">Yojiro Ogawa </a>decided they would have to make a completely new Sonic game to specifically fit the Wii hardware. To accomplish this task, he split the Sonic 2006 development team, taking half with him to go create <a href=\"/sonic-and-the-secret-rings/3030-2512\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2512\">Sonic &amp; the Secret Rings </a>for Nintendo's platform. Now working at half-capacity on an ambitious game for unfamiliar next-generation hardware, Sonic Team struggled towards Sonic 2006's impending Holiday season deadline, and was reportedly so behind schedule that many Quality Assurance Tester bug reports had to be ignored in order to get the game out on time.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791564\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791564\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/0/1486/791564-sonic_arch02.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Kingdom Valley with the scrapped day/night cycle.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Despite being a focal point of the original gameplay demonstration, the game's day/night cycle was removed shortly after the game was unveiled.</li><li>A number of online multiplayer modes were at one point planned; Time Trial, Ring Race, and most cryptically, \"Quiz\".

However, no such ghost feature or mode exists in the final release.</li><li>The Tokyo Game Show 2006 trailer for the game showcases a build of Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) that is somewhat different from the final release. There are a large number of additional visual effects and complex animations present in the TGS 2006 trailer that simply do not exist in the final retail version of the game.</li><li>Even though customizing Sonic's abilities was one of the game's selling points, the final retail game features almost no customization at all. Most ability upgrades are required in order to finish the game, and while the player can purchase special gems near the end of Sonic's story, they cannot be \"customized\" in any way shape or form - once equipped, you have them forever.</li><li>The instruction manual for Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) contains a number of inaccuracies that do not accurately reflect the final game. For example: It describes the possibility of leveling up abilities equipped to the action gauge up to three levels of \"maturity\". The action gauge is never used like this by any character in the game, and unless he's carrying Princess Elise, Sonic's action gauge is never used for anything.</li><li>The manual also makes reference to a green shield power-up (similar to one seen in past Sonic games). No shield power is ever acquired from item pickups, nor is any green shield power-up ever accessible.</li><li>In addition, the manual also mentions that Tails and Omega can only fly until their \"Flight Gauge\" depletes.

It is heavily inspired by the classic <a href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3025-383\" data-ref-id=\"3025-383\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> games but is so is also reminiscent of other <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Sega Genesis/Mega Drive</a> games. The game features two modes of play, Adventure mode and Classic Mode. Adventure Mode offers the same gameplay as Classic Mode but includes a large amount of cutscenes and story that are fully voice acted and animated, Classic Mode is for players who strictly want to play the game. Freedom Planet stars three young ladies as playable characters, <a href=\"/sash-lilac/3005-32106\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32106\">Lilac</a> the dragon, <a href=\"/carol-tea/3005-32107\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32107\">Carol</a> the wildcat and <a href=\"/milla-basset/3005-32108\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32108\">Milla</a> the basset hound.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The player controls one of three characters, Lilac, Carol, or Milla, and must platform across levels and battle robot enemies that get in the way. The levels contain loop-the-loops, corkscrews, spring pads and other obstacles and mechanisms that help and hinder the player. Some levels have gates that require special actions in order to pass through, like destroying a crystal or finding a key. Each level has a mini-boss, located about half way through the level and a boss at the end of the level.</p><p>The player is allowed to take damage and it is gauged by petals that act as hit points, this meter is located in the upper left corner. Lilac has seven health petals, Carol also has seven health petals and Milla only has health four petals. If the player looses all health petals then a life is lost, lives are indicated in the upper left corner as well. Players can also get shield power-ups, these have different properties based on what color of crystal is smashed. Green is a wood shield, yellow is an earth shield, blue is a water shield, red is a fire shield, silver is a metal shield and rainbow grants invincibility.</p><p>Each character has some basic attacks as well as a special attack that is unique to them. The basic attacks change based on the direction being held when the attack button is pushed, they are similar between characters. The special attack is more powerful but depletes the special meter, the meter must refill in order to use the special again, it is located in the upper left corner. Lilac has an air dash, Carol has a rapid kick move and Milla throws a gelatinous energy cube. The characters also have other special characteristics differentiating their play style. Lilac has a double jump, Carol can cling to walls and ride a motorcycle and Milla can fly temporarily by flapping her ears.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The ruthless Lord Brevon crash lands on the planet Avalice, he soon learns of a powerful gemstone, the Kingdom stone, that is powering the three local cities. In order to repair his spacecraft he devises a plan to trick the three cities into fighting with one another so he can steal the Kingdom Stone without there interference and repair his ship. Meanwhile another spacecraft crash lands on Avalice containing Torque the Shellduck. Torque is rescued from the crash by two young ladies, Lilac and Carol who are on there way to see the Kingdom Stone. Torque informs them of Lord Brevons evil ways and the group decides they must protect the Kingdom Stone and thwart Lord Brevon's plans.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The project was conceived by game designer and programmer Steven DiDuro who founded GalaxyTrail games to create the project. It was originally designed to be a Sonic fan project and included Doctor Robotnik/Eggman as the villain and a ring based health system but it was decided it would only limit the project.</p><p>A demo for Freedom Planet was initially posted on <a href=\"http://galaxytrail.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GalaxyTrail's website</a> in 2012 as a proof of concept. The project was then <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/galaxytrail/freedom-planet-high-speed-platform-game\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Kickstarted</a> on January 15, 2013 where it raised $25,472 from 1,105 backers. The title was also placed into Steam Greenlight a day later and was officially Greenlit in August of 2013. The project was officially released around a year later on July 21, 2014. Freedom Planet was announced to release on the Wii U on March, 8 2015, no official date has been scheduled for that release.</p>", "deck": "An independently developed 2D platformer that shares many similarities to the early Sonic games, as well as Ristar and Gunstar Heroes.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/97089/2465736-m.png", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97089/2465736-m.png", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/97089/2465736-m.png", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/97089/2465736-m.png", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/97089/2465736-m.png", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/97089/2465736-m.png", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/97089/2465736-m.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/freedom-planet/3030-39276/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39276/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": "2014-07-21 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/", "id": 29, "name": "ESRB: E10+"}], "date_added": "2012-08-08 05:40:27", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WIIU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/", "abbreviation": "LIN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/", "id": 152, "name": "Linux"}], "id": 39276, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Freedom Planet"}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Freedom Planet"}

It features a brand new world, Pacifica, as well as a new boss, Kroctopus.</p><p>The game also sported a completely new soundtrack from <a href=\"/david-wise/3040-33306\" data-ref-id=\"3040-33306\">David Wise</a>, composer for Donkey Kong Country 2, although the music has been criticised for not holding up to that of the original by <a href=\"/eveline-novakovic/3040-50659\" data-ref-id=\"3040-50659\">Eveline Fischer</a> (now Novakovic).</p><p>The port has also replaced the original Swanky Sideshow <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigames</a> with some new boat games from <a href=\"/funky-kong/3005-1647\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1647\">Funky</a>, a star-collection game set in a sewer tube with Swanky, and an echidna-blocking game with Cranky Kong. <a href=\"/wrinkly-kong/3005-13171\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13171\">Wrinkly</a>'s save caves have been replaced by Cranky's Dojo now that the game allows the player to save at any time on the world map by hitting the start button.</p><p>The port has slightly changed physics from the original game which may be noticeable when playing them side by side; most notably that characters will move at a much slower rate in the port, including in the toboggan levels. There are also a few levels which have had objects shifted to fit with these slower character speeds, but sometimes this affects the original puzzles of levels, such as platforms being lowered to be accessible from points unreachable before, and some DK coins being accessible without figuring out a puzzle and collecting them the way the game had originally intended.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The soundtrack for Donkey Kong Country 3 was the first soundtrack in the Donkey Kong Country series to not be solely composed by <a href=\"/david-wise/3040-33306\" data-ref-id=\"3040-33306\">David Wise</a>. Instead, <a href=\"/eveline-novakovic/3040-50659\" data-ref-id=\"3040-50659\">Eveline Fischer</a> was responsible for most of the composition with some help by David Wise.</p><h3>Tracklist</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1782583-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1782583\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9758064516129\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1782583-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1782583\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1782583-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1782583-1.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Soundtrack cover</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Dixie Beat</li><li>Crazy Calypso</li><li>Northern Kremisphere</li><li>Hangin' at Funky's</li><li>Wrinkly's Save Cave</li><li>Get Fit A-Go-Go</li><li>Wrinkly 64</li><li>Brothers Bear</li><li>Sub-Map Shuffle</li><li>Swanky's Sideshow</li><li>Cranky's Showdown</li><li>Showdown Win</li><li>Showdown Lose</li><li>Bonus Time</li><li>Bonus Win</li><li>Bonus Lose</li><li>Stilt Village</li><li>Mill Fever</li><li>Jangle Bells</li><li>Frosty Frolics</li><li>Treetop Tumble</li><li>Enchanted Riverbank</li><li>Hot Pursuit</li><li>Water World</li><li>Nuts and Bolts</li><li>Pokey Pipes</li><li>Rockface Rumble</li><li>Jungle Jitter</li><li>Cavern Caprice</li><li>Rocket Run</li><li>Boss Boogie</li><li>Crystal Chasm</li><li>Krematoa Koncerto</li><li>Big Boss Blues</li><li>Mama Bird</li><li>Chase</li><li>Baddies on Parade</li><li>Game Over</li></ol>", "deck": "The final installment in the original Donkey Kong Country trilogy for the Super Nintendo.

The game follows the adventures of Disney mascot <a href=\"/mickey-mouse/3005-2363\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2363\">Mickey Mouse</a>, and his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, as they attempt to rescue Alice from the Disney movie \"Alice in Wonderland\".</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The player guides Mickey through the Fun House, the Forest, the Pirate Ship, and finally the Castle. Combat includes Mickey tossing stars at enemies such as snakes and spiders. Mickey can refill portions of his health bar by collecting diamonds that are available throughout the levels.</p><p> </p><h2>Localization</h2><p>Capcom made a number of changes to the game before its sale to the American audience. The Japanese version dealt primarily with characters and elements taken from Alice in Wonderland; the US version of the game introduces more characters from the Disney universe, replacing Cheshire Cat with Witch Hazel as the game's first boss, and introducing enemies from The Jungle Book, Sleeping Beauty, the Country Bear Jamboree, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Capcom-published game employs diamonds as a means of replenishing Mickey's life bar, whereas players of the original game would collect the head of Donald Duck to return back to full health. Also, Mickey shoots white balls in the Japanese version of the game, while our hero shoots stars in the US release.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13573/474976-mickey_mousecapade_nes_screenshot4_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-474976\" data-size=\"large\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13573/474976-mickey_mousecapade_nes_screenshot4_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-474976\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/13573/474976-mickey_mousecapade_nes_screenshot4_1_.gif\"/></a><figcaption>Mickey and Minnie in the Fun House</figcaption></figure>", "deck": "Help Mickey and Minnie save Alice in Wonderland from the evil clutches of Maleficent in this punishing platformer for the NES.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/9/93770/2362065-nes_mickeymousecapades.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/93770/2362065-nes_mickeymousecapades.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/9/93770/2362065-nes_mickeymousecapades.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93770/2362065-nes_mickeymousecapades.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/9/93770/2362065-nes_mickeymousecapades.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/9/93770/2362065-nes_mickeymousecapades.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362065-nes_mickeymousecapades.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mickey-mousecapade/3030-17706/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-17706/", "number_of_user_reviews": 1, "original_release_date": "1987-03-06 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:35:40", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System"}], "id": 17706, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Mickey Mousecapade"}, "platform": "NES", "title": "Mickey Mousecapade"}

In Mexico, Goofy gives Donald the red plungers and these can stick to wall for a limited time and can be used to get to unreachable places. Lastly, the Viking Captain gives Donald the green plunger which can be attached to birds; holding onto them will bring Donald along for the ride. Donald is also equipped with another gun with limited ammo and this gun fires popcorn and bubble gum. He can find pieces of corn and gum to refill this weapon.

The core gameplay consists of a well partially filled with either 5 or 6 distinct types of tiles, depending on the difficulty level. Adjacent tiles may be swapped horizontally with the cursor, and matching three or more tiles vertically or horizontally will result in the tiles clearing after a short delay animation, during which they become immovable. Additional points may be earned with either \"combos,\" which involve clearing more than 3 tiles simultaneously, or \"chains,\" which require that the tiles above a clearing set fall into another clear. During play, the stack of tiles will slowly rise to the top of the screen, though clearing tiles will pause this advance. After a grace period after the stack reaches the top of the well, the game will end.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The version of Panel de Pon included in the Japan-only Nintendo Puzzle Collection has more differences from the original game than any other game included on the disc. The game is essentially the same as <a href=\"../../pokemon-puzzle-league/61-8052/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League</a>, as it is a version of the game skinned as \"Panel de Pon 64.\" Thus, it features many of the same things as Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League (such as a 3D mode, new characters, updated graphics, and a new four-player mode, which wasn't in Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle League). Despite these changes, gameplay-wise it is nothing more than an enhanced version of Panel de Pon.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are 5 major game modes in Tetris Attack. In most modes, a difficulty level may be selected, and in some modes an initial speed may be selected; this may be confusing to new players, but while the difficulty level affects the rate at which death occurs, the number of tile types in play, and the rate at which tiles fall upon finding themselves in mid-air, the initial speed merely controls the speed at which the stack rises.</p><h3>Endless</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This mode allows the player to select a difficulty level and speed, and allows nearly limitless play. The name of the mode is misleading, however, as gameplay will necessarily end: either the player will die, or reach 99,999 points, upon which the game will end. Should the player reach this maximum point score, credits will be rolled.</p><h3>Time Trial</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This mode provides a 2 minute length of time in which to earn as many points as possible. The difficulty and speed may be set prior to the game. This mode may be played with either 1 or 2 players.</p><h3>Stage Clear</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Stage Clear mode requires that players clear the stack down to a particular \"clear line\" to pass each stage, of which there are several per character in the game. In addition, there are certain \"boss battles,\" in which the player must earn points as quickly as possible to reduce the boss's HP level to zero.</p><h3>Puzzle</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This mode involves a collection of designed puzzles, of which there are ten per character in the game, as well as many \"special\" levels, totaling 120 levels. Each involves a set of tiles that must be cleared completely within the predetermined number of tile swaps.</p><h3>VS</h3><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/392219-tetris_attack042.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392219\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/392219-tetris_attack042.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392219\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/392219-tetris_attack042.png\"/></a><figcaption>A screenshot of gameplay</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The VS mode is the only game mode to feature the Garbage mechanic, as well as the only mode which features a computer-controlled AI. In it, each player attempts to stay alive and force the other player to lose first. This may be done by dumping \"garbage blocks\" upon the other player, by creating either combos or chains. Increasingly large combos will result in larger-width as well as multiple single slabs of garbage to be dropped on the player's opponent, while increasingly large chains will result in thicker single blocks of garbage. Clearing garbage may be done by matching three or more tiles adjacent to the garbage, upon which all the garbage in contact in the stack will flash and begin transforming into normal tiles, starting from the very bottom and progressing to the top of the garbage stack. These tiles, though revealed, are not in play until the entire stack has transformed, upon which it will fall onto the existing stack; this lag time is in turn an excellent time to anticipate and create large combos and chains. However, garbage created with chains consists of single multilayer blocks; these blocks will not completely transform with each attempt - instead, only the bottom layer will become normal tiles, while the rest will transform back into a single block.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In addition, there are special tiles in the VS mode which are gray and marked with exclamation points. These appear only sporadically, and, when matched, create special \"steel\" garbage blocks to be dropped on the player's opponent. These are unique because they do not clear when in contact with regular clearing garbage - they must be cleared separately. This effectively limits the clearing ability of one's opponent, and is particularly useful when sandwiched between two large segments of regular garbage.</p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a></li><li>Bumpty</li><li>Flutter</li><li>Gargantua Blargg</li><li>Lunge Fish</li><li><a href=\"/prince-froggy/3005-12897\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12897\">Prince Froggy</a></li><li><a href=\"/lakitu/3005-927\" data-ref-id=\"3005-927\">Lakitu</a></li><li><a href=\"/poochy/3005-826\" data-ref-id=\"3005-826\">Poochy</a></li><li><a href=\"/hookbill-the-koopa/3005-12900\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12900\">Hookbill the Koopa</a></li><li><a href=\"/naval-piranha/3005-12898\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12898\">Naval Piranha</a></li><li><a href=\"/kamek/3005-1227\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1227\">Kamek</a></li><li><a href=\"/bowser/3005-337\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a></li></ul><h2>Scoring</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As mentioned above, tiles may be cleared in either \"combos\" or \"chains\" for additional points.</p><h3>Combos</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Combos are achieved by clearing more than three tiles simultaneously. This can be done either through clever tile manipulation, or by matching tiles to inactive rows as they appear on screen. A more advanced method, called \"garbage chaining,\" involves matching tiles in play with clearing rows of garbage from above. This is particularly useful for dealing with single blocks of thick garbage.</p><h3>The scoring details of combos are as follows:</h3><ul><li><strong>4 tiles:</strong> 20 points</li><li><strong>5 tiles:</strong> 30 points</li><li><strong>6 tiles:</strong> 50 points</li><li><strong>7 tiles:</strong> 60 points</li><li><strong>8 tiles:</strong> 70 points</li><li><strong>9 tiles:</strong> 80 points</li><li><strong>10 tiles:</strong> 100 points</li><li><strong>11 tiles:</strong> 140 points</li><li><strong>12 tiles:</strong> 170 points</li></ul><h3>Chains</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Chains are much more difficult to plan and execute than combos, and are thus worth substantially more points. Tiles must fall from above a clear into another clear to create a chain; once this condition is failed, the chain ends and a new one must be initiated. There are several advanced techniques involving chains, many of which are detailed in <strong>Advanced Gameplay Mechanics</strong> below. Noteworthy, however, is the fact that Tetris Attack does <em>not</em> in fact recognize chains of longer than 13 - rather than the standard x14 or x15 icon which would be the expected result of further chaining, players are presented with a x? icon and rewarded no points whatsoever for their continued efforts.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another nuance in the scoring system involving chains, however, is that of \"bonuses.\" When a normal clear is made alongside a chain, that clear is awarded the same number of points as the current chain clear, instead of the standard clear amount. Thus, a standard strategy when trying to score points quickly is to quickly build out to a x13 chain, then instantly initiating as many standard three tile clears on the side as possible to maximize the number of points earned on the chain.</p><h3>The scoring details of chains are as follows:</h3><ul><li><strong>x2 chain:</strong> 50 points</li><li><strong>x3 chain:</strong> 80 points</li><li><strong>x4 chain:</strong> 150 points</li><li><strong>x5 chain:</strong> 300 points</li><li><strong>x6 chain:</strong> 400 points</li><li><strong>x7 chain:</strong> 500 points</li><li><strong>x8 chain:</strong> 700 points</li><li><strong>x9 chain:</strong> 900 points</li><li><strong>x10 chain:</strong> 1100 points</li><li><strong>x11 chain:</strong> 1300 points</li><li><strong>x12 chain:</strong> 1500 points</li><li><strong>x13 chain:</strong> 1800 points</li><li><strong>x14 chain:</strong> 0 points</li></ul><h2>Advanced Gameplay Mechanics</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Several nuances in Tetris Attack's engine allow for unique techniques while playing Tetris Attack. Since most rules are calculated on a frame-by-frame basis, some of the basic physical rules of the game can be bent - others may be broken. For instance, it is possible for a single tile to very briefly, while in the process of shifting between two columns, support two sets of falling tiles above it, just long enough to register the above tiles as a clear should they be positioned as such. This is particularly useful as a last-resort when attempted to keep chains alive. It is also possible, though vastly more difficult, to swap tiles in midair as they fall, and to swap tiles \"through\" clear arrangements such as they do not trigger the clear.</p><h2>Story and Multiple Endings</h2><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/392205-tetris_attack028.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392205\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/392205-tetris_attack028.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392205\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/392205-tetris_attack028.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/392205-tetris_attack028.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Choosing one of the friends to free.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Tetris Attack's story is rather loose: there appears to be some sort of curse which has befallen all the major characters (who were enemies from <a href=\"/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/3030-2866\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2866\">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a>, but are apparently now friends) except for <a href=\"/yoshi/3005-700\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi</a>, and Yoshi must therefore battle each character in a VS mode match to free them. Upon freeing <a href=\"/lakitu/3005-927\" data-ref-id=\"3005-927\">Lakitu</a>, Bumpty, <a href=\"/poochy/3005-826\" data-ref-id=\"3005-826\">Poochy</a>, Flying Wiggler, Froggy, Blargg, Lunge Fish, and Rafael the Raven, the gang continues on to defeat Hookbill the Koopa, Naval Piranha, <a href=\"/kamek/3005-1227\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1227\">Kamek</a>, and finally <a href=\"/bowser/3005-337\" data-ref-id=\"3005-337\">Bowser</a> (in difficulty levels above easy) in the Cave of Darkness to win the day. Upon completion on hard, a code is given to the player to unlock \"hardest\" mode, and upon completion of hardest mode without dying, another code is given which allows the selection of characters prior to each match rather than only matches in the Cave of Darkness; the point is to choose characters other than Yoshi, as hinted at in the dialogue. Each level of completion involves a different set of dialogue at the end. However, this final step to achieving the VS mode \"perfect\" ending is rather superfluous, as it is no more difficult than beating the game on hardest without dying without the character selection.</p>", "deck": "Tetris Attack, derived from Panel de Pon in Japan, is one of the founding members of the \"swap and match\" tile-based puzzle gameplay style.", "aliases": "Panel de Pon", "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/7465/782521-tetris_attack_box_art.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/782521-tetris_attack_box_art.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/7465/782521-tetris_attack_box_art.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/782521-tetris_attack_box_art.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/7465/782521-tetris_attack_box_art.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/7465/782521-tetris_attack_box_art.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/782521-tetris_attack_box_art.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tetris-attack/3030-13130/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-13130/", "number_of_user_reviews": 2, "original_release_date": "1996-08-05 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-9/", "id": 9, "name": "ESRB: K-A"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:07:28", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-3/", "abbreviation": "GB", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy/3045-3/", "id": 3, "name": "Game Boy"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-9/", "abbreviation": "SNES", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/", "id": 9, "name": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-36/", "abbreviation": "Wii", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/", "id": 36, "name": "Wii"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WIIU", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U"}], "id": 13130, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Tetris Attack"}, "platform": "SNES", "title": "Tetris Attack"}

TNT: Evilution was developed by TeamTNT and The Plutonia Experiment was developed by the Casali brothers also from TeamTNT.

Each game has a massive 32 levels (30 official and 2 secret levels.)</p><p>The game was released as the definitive challenge for the Doom veterans wanting more, hence the high difficulty and the name <i>Final Doom</i>.</p><p>A <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation</a> version was later released containing levels from Final Doom and the map pack \"Master Levels for Doom II.\"</p><h2>TNT: Evilution</h2><p>Evilution is a game containing entirely new sprites and music tracks made by the developers. Features a slightly easier difficulty level than Plutonia, which ramps up towards harder levels instead of starting out at the highest difficulty.

They both have a high firing rate and are generally useful in the same situations. The main difference between them is the projectile speed. Whereas the Chaingun's bullets hit the target instantly, the Plasma Gun's shots have to travel through the air before hitting the target, making it possible for enemies to dodge incoming attacks. The trade-off for this inaccuracy is a much higher damage output. The Plasma Gun shares ammunition with the BFG9000, so many players rarely use the Plasma Gun after getting the BFG.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><a href=\"/bfg9000/3055-26\" data-ref-id=\"3055-26\"><b>BFG9000</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1408586-gzdoom_2010_06_17_14_30_25_80.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408586\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1408586-gzdoom_2010_06_17_14_30_25_80.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408586\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13692/1408586-gzdoom_2010_06_17_14_30_25_80.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13692/1408586-gzdoom_2010_06_17_14_30_25_80.png\"/></noscript></a></figure> The acronym in the name stands for Big Fucking Gun, and one thing is certain: it <i>is</i> a big fucking gun. The BFG9000 fires a huge plasma ball which moves slowly through the air.

The player in unable to damage himself with the weapon, which makes it the best weapon of choice against large groups of enemies that are relatively close to the player.</td></tr></tbody></table>",

It is primarily an action game, however it also incorporates a number of elements which were not common to shooters at the time, including a large unified game world, a quest-like mission system, and a significant amount of <a href=\"/voice-acting/3015-1413\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1413\">voice-over</a> throughout. Some of the gameplay systems on display, such as Strife's use of a player <a href=\"/inventory/3015-513\" data-ref-id=\"3015-513\">inventory</a> system and a hub-like level structure, can be seen in <a href=\"/raven-software/3010-1841\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1841\">Raven Software</a>'s earlier <a href=\"/heretic/3025-302\" data-ref-id=\"3025-302\">Heretic games</a>, which were also based on id technology. Strife also introduces a number of changes not previously seen in a Doom derivative, and embraces in particular many of the trappings of the role-playing genre, as outside of missions players are able to freely explore settlements where they are free to converse with <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">non-player characters</a>, purchase items from vendors, or search for additional side activities all without needing to engage in combat. Strife was the last of the major retail Doom engine games to be released, with the others being <a href=\"/heretic/3030-10469\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10469\">Heretic</a>, <a href=\"/hexen/3030-22548\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22548\">Hexen</a>, and, of course, <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> (and <a href=\"/doom-ii-hell-on-earth/3030-621\" data-ref-id=\"3030-621\">Doom II</a>).</p><p>Having been released several months after the arrival of the popular <a href=\"/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3407\">Duke Nukem 3D</a> and its more technologically advanced <a href=\"/build-engine/3015-1733\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1733\">Build engine</a>, and scarcely a month prior to the much-anticipated <a href=\"/quake/3030-8015\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8015\">Quake</a> and its fully <a href=\"/polygonal-3d/3015-1430\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">polygonal</a> <a href=\"/quake-engine/3015-1278\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1278\">Quake engine</a>, Strife did not receive the same amount of attention that many of its Doom engine forebears did. Reviewers at the time often noted that the game's graphical presentation was simply behind the times when stacked up against other contemporary titles (or those just on the horizon), though at the same time it also received positive remarks for paying attention to certain game elements which were commonly neglected by many shooters of its day, such as story and a cohesive environment.</p><p>The game was rereleased as \"The Original Strife: Veteran Edition\". It was released for PC, Mac, and Linux via <a href=\"/steam/3015-718\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a> on December 12, 2014.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The events of Strife take place within a world stricken by disease and oppression. In a time before, the world had been peaceful, even idyllic, though this reality was abruptly shattered and replaced by one far more bleak the day a solitary comet collided with the planet. In droves, People mysteriously began to fall sick, and millions would soon perish in a massive viral outbreak which coincided with the comet's arrival. Not all that were afflicted by the plague would die, but those that didn't laid claim to hearing a voice within their heads, a voice which they were compelled to obey. Those who could hear the voice began to look down upon those who could not, and before long they formed The Order, an organization devoted to achieving the goals of The One God, no matter the cost. The unafflicted were forced to submit to The Order; all aspects of life would eventually come under Order control, even procreation, and The Order's violent and indiscriminate ways led the remaining survivors to hide what few healthy women and children that remained below ground, as far from The Order's reach as could be mustered.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2093705-the_order.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2093705\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2093705-the_order.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2093705\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2093705-the_order.png\"/></a><figcaption>The Order quickly seizes control in the wake of the viral epidemic.</figcaption></figure><p>For a time, those who suffered under The Order's persecution thought of little else save survival or escape from their bonds. Unfortunately, it became ever more apparent with the passage of time that The Order's influence was all-pervasive, and that if left unchecked the last remnants of humanity would simply be hunted to extinction or converted into mindless servants. It was from this realization that the resistance movement known as The Front came to be, a desperate gathering of citizens hoping to wrest The Order's influence from the lives of the populace by force. With The Order's significant numbers, advanced weaponry, and zealous methods, The Front could not afford to openly combat their adversaries until the conditions were right, and so its operatives maintained the utmost secrecy, hiding in the shadows and gathering arms and recruits where they could be found while also gathering any information that could possibly give them an edge against their oppressors.</p><p>The player enters these circumstances under the guise of a wandering mercenary whose displeasure with The Order has led him to offer his services to The Front. After a brief test of loyalty, the resistance welcomes him into the fold, sending him on important missions against The Order. Over the course of the game, the mercenary encounters and defeats several important figures within the cult, including The Programmer, The Bishop, and The Loremaster. Toward the game's climax, the wanderer discovers that The Order is controlled by an otherworldly being known as The Entity, and that the comet that heralded the beginning of the troubles was presumably the vessel that the creature had arrived in. Defeating The Entity is the player's final task in Strife, and depending upon what actions were taken beforehand, one of two endings is possible after winning, as well as a third in which the player loses to The Entity. In the better of the two endings, both The Order and the plague are eradicated, while in the lesser ending, the plague persists despite The Order's demise, causing the survivors to lose hope.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>At the game's outset, the player arrives in the town of Tarnhill hoping to contact The Front. Tarnhill represents one of several neutral \"hub\" zones within Strife in which the player will not be attacked unless they behave aggressively. These areas serve a number of gameplay purposes. Missions are typically accepted and turned in within them, and they also contain various shops from which players can purchase weapons, <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammunition</a>, <a href=\"/armor/3055-574\" data-ref-id=\"3055-574\">armor</a>, <a href=\"/health-pack/3055-255\" data-ref-id=\"3055-255\">health packs</a>, and other items. Furthermore, certain characters here also have the ability to increase the player's weapon accuracy and maximum hit points. Both can be upgraded a total of ten times over the course of the game, though there are usually prerequisites for receiving said upgrades. Players are rewarded with currency upon completing most missions, and it is understood (and in some instances specifically verbalized) that the player is to use this money in order to prepare themselves for the coming missions. In this sense, the hub areas of Strife can be viewed as interludes in the midst of the game's main action, places free from danger in which players can recuperate and restock before heading back out into more hostile lands.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2094783-tarnhill_bar.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094783\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2094783-tarnhill_bar.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2094783\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2094783-tarnhill_bar.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2094783-tarnhill_bar.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>A glimpse of the Tarnhill tavern, a location within the game's starting area.</figcaption></figure><p>Connected to the more centralized neutral zones are a variety of additional levels which the player must travel to in order to complete their objectives. These levels typically (but not always) require the player to engage in large amounts of combat, and it is within them that the game most resembles a traditional Doom-era first-person shooter. Enemies behave in rather straightforward fashion, usually waiting at a fixed point until the player passes by, which triggers them to attack. Quest objectives often do not specifically require the player to kill enemies within mission-critical areas, nonetheless it is not uncommon for the player to end up subduing the larger part of the enemy presence there over the course of a mission. There are some exceptions to this, the most notable being several maps in which the player has the option to infiltrate an Order-controlled area rather than simply resorting to violence. In these instances the player is able to remain incognito in the presence of foes that might otherwise attack. Triggering an alarm or acting suspiciously will still cue enemies to attack, and furthermore certain foes will always recognize the player as a threat, however this stealth system, if used properly, can allow players to successfully avoid combat in a number of situations.</p><p>As the game progresses, the player gradually gains access to larger segments of the game world, and in a similar fashion to earlier instances of more open first-person games, such as <a href=\"/system-shock/3030-13948\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13948\">System Shock</a>, there are very few restrictions placed upon the player when it comes to revisiting previous areas. Level progression is similar to <a href=\"/hexen/3030-22548\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22548\">Hexen</a>, in which a central hub level branches out into a number of attached levels that the player can travel back and forth from at will. Unlike Hexen's hub system, however, which transports the player to a new hub after finishing the current one, Strife is composed of a single interconnected set of levels, and as a result toward the game's end the player will be able to travel to almost any prior point in the game if they so choose. Outside of the game's hub areas, though, there is very little necessity or incentive to revisit most environments, as the player's actions within the world are persistent throughout, meaning that enemies and items will not respawn upon returning to previous levels.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>The Strife arsenal consists of eight weapons, including some well-worn staples of the first-person action game, such as an <a href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">assault rifle</a>, a <a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launcher</a>, and a <a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotgun</a> equivalent. The means of acquiring these weapons can vary. They may be given, found, purchased, or constructed, and the most powerful of them can only be completed after defeating five bosses. Several of these armaments have more than one firing mode or a second ammunition type, and in these cases the player can cycle to the alternate mode or ammo simply by pressing that weapon's selection button a second time. Weapon ammo can be found throughout most levels, but it is often wise to purchase additional ammunition for the weapons one expects to use when the opportunity to do so arises, especially in the case of rarer types of ammunition. The Ammo Satchel item is also worth investing in early on, as it double's the player's ammo capacity across all weapons.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Appearance</th><th>Icon</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure style=\"width: 196px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2092689-punch_dagger.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2092689\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.55612244897959\" data-width=\"196\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2092689-punch_dagger.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2092689\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2092689-punch_dagger.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2092689-punch_dagger.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Punch Dagger</figcaption></figure></td><td><ul><li>None (Starting Weapon)</li></ul></td><td><h3>Punch Dagger</h3><ul><li><u>Ammunition Type</u>: None</li></ul> The token melee implement of Strife, the Punch Dagger is the player's only defense at the beginning of the game, and is unsurprisingly outclassed as soon as the player obtains a ranged weapon.

One commonality between them is the use of cybernetic or robotic components, as The Order seems to view traditional human biology as imperfect. Many of The Order's agents are a hybrid of man and machine, while others are completely devoid of any identifiable human components. Having their basis in the worship of The One God, The Order has also taken to lending the names of many of its creations an overtly religious bent, with titles like Crusader and Acolyte likely intended to cement the righteousness of its cause in the minds of The Order's followers. In total, Strife includes eight standard foes that are encountered with varying degrees of frequency, and five boss-level opponents that are either entirely unique or seen only on rare occasions. Initiates within The Order tend to be the most identifiably human, whereas it is not uncommon for higher-ranking foes to incorporate mechanical or alien physiology to a much larger degree.</p><h3><u>Standard Enemies</u></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><figure style=\"width: 60px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2092703-turret.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2092703\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"60\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2092703-turret.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2092703\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2092703-turret.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2092703-turret.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Turret</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>Turret</h3> Encountered frequently throughout the game, Turrets are placed in any area The Order wishes to protect from encroachment.

As defensive constructs, if no general alert has been raised, Turrets will not attack the player, though once they have been activated, they will open fire whenever the player is within its line-of-sight.</td></tr><tr><td><figure style=\"width: 64px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2092660-acolyte.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2092660\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9375\" data-width=\"64\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:193.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2092660-acolyte.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2092660\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2092660-acolyte.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2092660-acolyte.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Acolyte</figcaption></figure></td><td><h3>Acolyte</h3> Acting as The Order's standard grunt, the Acolyte is a cybernetically \"enhanced\" human that follows its directives without question.

As if high explosives and advanced energy weaponry wasn't enough, the Inquisitor is also surprisingly mobile due to the inclusion of jump jets that allow it to scale walls or cross chasms that other foes might not be able to.

He is also notable for being the only non-Spectre boss in the game (aside from the final boss) without a secondary Spectre form.

The game was initially released in 1994. An updated version of the game, named System Shock: Enhanced Edition, was released via <a href=\"/gogcom/3015-2379\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">Gog.com</a> on September 22, 2015.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is set in the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/cyberpunk/3015-6735\">cyberpunk</a> future of 2072, and the events of the game take place entirely within the confines of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/citadel-station/3035-3431\">Citadel Station</a> as a solitary <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/hacking/3015-1154\">hacker</a>, controlled by the player, attempts to thwart the machinations of the station's <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/hostile-ai/3015-726\">delusional artificial intelligence</a>. System Shock introduced many features which were uncommon to first-person gaming at the time, including full range of player movement which allowed for leaning, crouching, jumping, and 360-degree control over the viewing angle, and an engine which supported true <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/polygonal-3d/3015-1430\">three-dimensional</a> architecture. Furthermore, the game's significant emphasis on narrative, tension, and exploration over sheer action was considered relatively novel for a first-person shooter in its day, and it is frequently mentioned as a major influence on the sensibilities of modern-day story-based action games.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">System Shock was met with moderate financial success and tremendous critical acclaim at the time of its release, which eventually led to the development of a sequel, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/system-shock-2/3030-8870\">System Shock 2</a>, in 1999, a title which experienced a similarly positive reception. Critics commonly commended the game for its heavily atmospheric setting, which was usually credited to a detailed graphical and audio presentation, and also for successfully melding action gameplay with more cerebral, puzzle-based activities. Many reviewers even went as far as to cite System Shock as a qualitative benchmark which future games would be judged against, in some cases even criticizing direct contemporaries such as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/doom/3030-7326\">Doom</a> which were perceived as overly simplistic games by comparison. This complexity was something of a double-edged sword, however, as one of the more common criticisms leveled against the game was that its controls were less than intuitive, and required a significant period of acclimation before players could move and interact comfortably within their environment.</p><h2>Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On April 7, 2072, in the city of New Atlanta, a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/the-nameless-hacker/3005-21096\">nameless hacker</a> infiltrates TriOptimum Corporation's corporate network, attempting for unknown reasons to access confidential information regarding their operations on Citadel Station. Though he is successful in gaining access to the network, the hacker is detected and apprehended by TriOptimum in the course of his unauthorized activities, and is brought to Citadel Station at the behest of the corrupt TriOptimum executive <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/edward-diego/3005-21095\">Edward Diego</a>. Rather than threatening the hacker with incarceration, Diego unexpectedly offers him a deal. If he agrees to hack into Citadel Station's Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network, or <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/shodan/3005-423\">SHODAN</a>, and hand control of it over to him, Diego promises to not only drop all charges against the hacker, but to also outfit him with a military-grade neural interface as compensation for a job well done. The hacker proves to be more than capable of the task, and after SHODAN's ethical constraints have been removed, Diego outfits the hacker with his new implant, after which he is placed in a recuperative sleep aboard Citadel Station for a period of six months as he coalesces from the operation.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2007025-shodanreborn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2007025\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2007025-shodanreborn.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2007025\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2007025-shodanreborn.png\"/></a><figcaption>Edward Diego observes as SHODAN's ethical constraints are removed.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game proper begins as the hacker awakens from his somnolent state to find the station in chaos. As he slumbered, Citadel Station was slowly overtaken by the self-aware SHODAN, who, without her former safeguards, had taken to experimenting upon the station's crew, creating various <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/cyborg/3015-950\">cyborgs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/mutants/3015-733\">mutant</a> abominations while aslo turning the station's <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/robots/3015-278\">robots</a> against those she didn't alter. SHODAN came to the conclusion that one of her infinite and infallible intelligence must in fact be a deity, and after taking control of the station, she decides to subjugate the inhabitants of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/earth/3035-65\">Earth</a>. Shortly after waking, the hacker is contacted by Rebecca Lansing, who claims to be a counter-terrorism consultant working for TriOptimum. She informs him that SHODAN is charging the station's mining laser for an attack against Earth, and enlists his aid, promising that if he succeeds TriOptimum will look the other way in regards to his dealings with Diego. The hacker succeeds in neutralizing the laser by discharging it into Citadel Station's own shields. SHODAN then informs him that she intends to unleash the same mutagen virus used against the station's crew upon Earth's unsuspecting populace, though once again she is foiled when the hacker jettisons the grove pod which she had chosen as an incubator for the virus.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">SHODAN next attempts to threaten Earth by downloading herself into the planet's computer network, which forces the hacker to destroy the four antennas used to transmit the data. With all threats neutralized, the hacker is informed that he has full authorization to scuttle the station. After entering the proper self-destruct codes into the station's reactor, he attempts to flee the station using an escape pod, only to find that SHODAN has disabled their use. All hope is not lost, however, as he receives information from Rebecca that SHODAN intends to disconnect the bridge level in order to save herself, and that he too can survive if he makes it there in time. The hacker arrives in time despite being confronted by SHODAN's most powerful enforcer, the cybernetically enhanced Edward Diego, along the way. With the computers that house SHODAN being heavily shielded, the only remaining means of confronting her lay in <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/cyberspace/3035-242\">cyberspace</a>, on her own territory. Despite the risk, the hacker enters cyberspace and defeats her. He is quickly offered a job at TriOptimum, which he declines, and when last he is seen the hacker is up to his old habits, this time hacking into the network of a corporation called TetraCorp.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">System Shock shares many design similarities with the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/ultima-underworld-the-stygian-abyss/3030-6413\">Ultima Underworld</a> games, which Looking Glass (known as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/blue-sky-productions/3010-3501\">Blue Sky Productions</a> during the Underworld days) had just finished creating. Additionally, System Shock's interface has been compared by some of the game's original developers to that of a flight simulator's cockpit, which was entirely unintentional, but happened naturally because key technical personnel on the System Shock team had previously worked making flight simulators. Further contributing to interface clutter was the contemporarily in vogue paradigm of mouse-driven GUIs, resulting in nearly every of the game's many systems being controllable via on screen visual indicators.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The player views the game world from the first person, with a large portion of the viewing area devoted to the game's elaborate <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/heads-up-display/3015-180\">heads-up display</a>, which allows quick access to various commands and information important to the player. The bottom portion of the screen is dedicated to System Shock's MFDs, or Multi-Function Displays, a series of three panels which the player can alter through various buttons along the screen's edge. This allows players to customize what information is shown on-screen at any given time, with options including, but not limited to, a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/minimap/3015-185\">mini-map</a>, detailed information regarding weapons and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/ammo/3055-533\">ammo</a>, and access to the player's <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/inventory/3015-513\">inventory</a>. Along the sides of the screen players can access several buttons which allow them to toggle various hardware attachments their character might possess, such as <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/jump-jets/3055-648\">jump jets</a> or infrared night vision. Full-screen mode can also be toggled in this way. Finally, along the top of the screen, players can access biological readouts detailing their levels of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/health/3015-130\">health</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/radiation/3015-728\">radiation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/poison/3015-287\">bio-toxin</a> exposure, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/fatigue/3015-5975\">stamina</a>, and energy. Centrally located at the top of the screen is a panel which gives players control over their viewing angle as well as their character's posture.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2007023-crewmassacre.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2007023\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2007023-crewmassacre.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2007023\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2007023-crewmassacre.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2007023-crewmassacre.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Citadel Station has seen better days.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Interaction with System Shock's game world is mostly accomplished with the mouse, either by double-clicking on objects one wishes to interact with, or right-clicking on enemies in order to attack them. Items can be placed in the player's inventory simply by dragging them toward it, and once there can be used by double-clicking. Players are for the most part expected to scavenge what they need to survive from their surroundings, and in a similar fashion are rarely told the exact specifics of what they must accomplish in order to defeat SHODAN, instead being encouraged to glean their next course of action from <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/audio-logs/3015-2038\">audio logs</a> and other resources left around Citadel Station. In fact, most aspects of progression in System Shock are tied in some manner to player exploration and investigation, whether it be acquiring new weapons and hardware by discovering hidden caches, or obtaining a door code by listening to the log of a dead crewman. Among the greatest of the benefits of exploration is the discovery of energy recharge stations and cyborg conversion chambers, which are invaluable resources to players who can find them.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In keeping with the game's more exploratory nature, each level of Citadel Station is a relatively large expanse, and players are usually able to explore the greater part of these levels without any restrictions save for their ability to handle the dangers therein. Most locks that are encountered are tied to the security in that particular level, and can be disabled by destroying <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/surveillance-camera/3055-898\">security cameras</a> and CPUs which SHODAN uses to exert her control. Levels are large enough that in many cases there exists more than one means to an end, and a situation that seems particularly difficult may be approachable from a more manageable angle. While the layout of the station definitely allows exploration, the main story does encourage players to visit levels in a set order, and while it is frequently possible to venture further into the station than the story requires, there is often little cause to do so, and just as often significant disincentives, as foes on deeper levels of the Citadel Station may be more dangerous than the player is prepared to handle.</p><h3>Cyberspace</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2007024-hostileconstruct.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2007024\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2007024-hostileconstruct.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2007024\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2007024-hostileconstruct.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2007024-hostileconstruct.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Defensive constructs such as this wish to prematurely end the hacker's forays.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One of the most original facets to System Shock's gameplay is the realization of cyberspace as an abstract virtual world the player can jack into using terminals scattered about Citadel Station. When a player jacks in, they are transported into a discreet wire-frame world in which they can travel freely and weightlessly in any direction. Cyberspace levels are arranged as rooms, where all of the action occurs, connected by networks of tunnels, where the player loses full control and is simply propelled ahead until the next room is entered; this structure crudely mirrors the architecture of a computer network (the player being an entity of data, the rooms as computers, and the tunnels wires). Interactions in cyberspace can yield explicit tangible effects on Citadel Station; a player might obtain useful information about their surroundings, or they may be able to unlock a door or restore power to certain areas they otherwise could not have. As with the rest of Citadel Station, however, SHODAN's malicious influence can be felt in cyberspace. Various defensive constructs are in place to halt the hacker's progress through the network, and if the player's software integrity (read: health meter) is fully depleted, the hacking attempt will fail, and the player is summarily booted from the network.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The player can fight back against these aggressive entities, though, and to this end several software programs can be acquired and upgraded within the realm of cyberspace in order to make safe passage a reality. Even when a hacking attempt fails due to a compromise of software integrity, any actions the player may have performed there before exiting will persist afterward, though the hacker himself will be injured and fatigued.</p><h3>Player Software Programs</h3><ul><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Pulser Combat</b>: The player's main weapon in cyberspace, the upgradeable Pulser is effective against any hostile construct which actively seeks to oust the player from the network.</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>I.C.E. Driller</b>: While not useful against normal defensive constructs, the Driller is invaluable in obtaining data that is locked away behind Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics.</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Turbo Navigation Booster</b>: Though the hacker is already pretty quick within cyberspace, Turbo Navigation Booster software effectively doubles his speed.</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Recall Escape</b>: The Get Out of Jail Free card of cyberspace, Recall Escape immediately transports its user to their point of origin.</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Fake ID</b>: The Fake ID software tool allows its user a one-time ability to deceive an I.C.E. defensive shield, convincing it to allow the player access to its data.</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Cybershield</b>: Other than evasion, the Cybershield is any hacker's primary means of protecting their software integrity, and can be upgraded over time.</p></li><li><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Decoy Evasion</b>: A means of temporary misdirection, Decoy Evasion creates a temporary false projection of its user, which is intended to fool defensive constructs.</p></li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The arsenal of System Shock is quite diverse, though it can generally be separated into the categories of melee, ballistic, energy, and grenade weapons. While all seven varieties of grenades can be carried at one time, the sixteen weapons that span the other weapon categories share limited inventory space, and thus no more than seven can be in the player's possession simultaneously. With the exception of the Mag-Pulse Rifle, all weapons in the energy category are powered by the player's built-in rechargeable energy reserves, while ballistic weapons each use unique ammo types, and, in most cases, individual ballistic weapons can select from more than one ammo type. Aside from the standard considerations of overall weapon damage, players must also bear in mind the weapon's overall effectiveness against organic and non-organic targets when choosing their implement. Many weapons and ammo types in System Shock are specifically tailored toward handling one type of threat over others, encouraging players to regularly reconsider the suitability of their weapons for the enemies that they expect to face.</p><h4>Melee Weapons</h4><table style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006933-leadpipe.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006933-leadpipe.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"138\" /></a></p></td><td><h3><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/lead-pipe/3055-150\">Lead Pipe</a></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The lowliest of System Shock's weapons, the meager Lead Pipe is obtained very early on, and this is just as well, since only the weakest of enemies are safe to tackle with it.

Why one would want to spare a slavering mutant or a murderous cyborg is a question for another day, but at the very least the DC-05 causes a great deal of knock back when it hits, allowing its user to retreat or switch to a deadlier weapon. An interesting feature of this gun is that it's only method of moving heavy crates and active landmines around the map, making it useful for setting traps and creative experimentation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006916-am_27flechette.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006916-am_27flechette.png\" height=\"28\" width=\"56\" /></a></p></td><td><h3><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/am-27-flechette/3055-3998\">AM-27 Flechette</a></h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A darling of the TriOptimum security force, the AM-27 fires needle-like projectiles that are particularly well-suited for penetrating and damaging flesh.

Special care should be taken when using it, as the Frag is not a timed device; rather, it will explode immediately upon impact once activated and thrown.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006925-empgrenade.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006925-empgrenade.png\" height=\"18\" width=\"14\" /><br /></a></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p></td><td><h3>EMP Grenade</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The EMP Grenade emits a concentrated electromagnetic pulse when deployed, which causes significant harm and disruption to any foes that rely on electrical systems, such as cyborgs and robots. If the blast does not completely disable the targeted threat, it will almost assuredly result in significant damage and also reduced functionality (i.e., slower speed) for a significant period of time.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006929-gasgrenade.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006929-gasgrenade.png\" height=\"21\" width=\"12\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Gas Grenade</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Producing an effect much stronger in nature than the usual civilian riot-control tear gas, the System Shock Gas Grenade is in fact a lethal tool that releases a compound containing diuranium oxide. The result of exposure to its gas is quite dramatic on biological life forms, as the gas's active ingredient results in near-instantaneous degeneration of any affected creature's nervous system.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006919-concussionbomb.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006919-concussionbomb.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"30\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Concussion Bomb</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With a focus on sheer explosive force, the Concussion Bomb produces an intense shock wave that is not specifically tailored toward any individual type of enemy, though is strong enough to cause critical damage to almost any target, robotic or otherwise. Its area of effect is somewhat larger than that of Fragmentation or Gas Grenades, so potential users should keep even greater distance from their foes.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006932-landmine.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006932-landmine.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"10\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Land Mine</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The main advantage of using the Land Mine over other explosives is its delayed explosion and proximity requirement. Not only must the Land Mine be completely stationary in order to detonate, but even then it must also come into direct contact with another object before exploding. This is particularly handy in laying traps for powerful foes, particularly when they can be funneled into a tight corridor.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006940-nitropack.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006940-nitropack.png\" height=\"19\" width=\"10\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Nitropack</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Composed of a volatile nitroglycerin-based explosive, the Nitropack is a timed explosive which can be thrown just like any other explosive weapon, though it will only detonate after its prespecified countdown has expired. Prior to use, the player can determine the Nitropack's fuse length, adjusting it anywhere between a single second to nearly a minute, depending on the situation's demands.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006924-earth_shaker.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006924-earth_shaker.png\" height=\"28\" width=\"14\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Earth-Shaker</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">An explosive device primarily intended for excavation purposes, the Earth-Shaker works very well against SHODAN's minions in a pinch. Much like the Nitropack, the Earth-Shaker's fuse length can be changed through the player's MFD prior to use, though perhaps because of the increased destructive force of the Earth-Shaker, the minimum fuse length allowed is four seconds.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Consumable Items</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In addition to the various armaments at the player's disposal, the hacker can carry on his person a number of beneficial consumable items for use at any time. The main class of consumables available are dermal patches, which have no carrying restrictions, though the player also has a secondary inventory which can be used to hold additional items of their choosing, though in more limited quantities. The benefits of dermal patches will often come with significant trade-offs, while inventory items typically have none.</p><h4>Dermal Patches</h4><table style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006947-staminupstimulant.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006947-staminupstimulant.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Staminup Stimulant</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Staminup Stimulant (or Stamup) greatly reduces fatigue for the duration of its effect. This can be very useful when traversing great distances, as rapid movement is liable to drain stamina very quickly. The downside of its use is that once the patch's effects have worn off, fatigue levels will spike quite dramatically, possibly leaving its user in a more compromising position than before.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006945-sightvisionenhancement.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006945-sightvisionenhancement.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Sight Vision Enhancement</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Sight Vision Enhancement dermal patch, as its name implies, gifts the player with a temporary boost in ocular acuity, which makes most areas appear brighter than they otherwise would. As the drug's effects wear off, the environment will gradually begin to dim, and at the end of the patch's duration one's surroundings will actually appear significantly darker for a short period.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006918-berserkcombatbooster.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006918-berserkcombatbooster.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Berserk Combat Booster</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Berserker Combat Booster is designed to augment its user's skill on one thing and one thing only: hand-to-hand combat. While active, the player's upper-body strength is greatly enhanced, granting more melee damage, though as a side effect, the player is also prone to severe visual hallucinations (manifesting in-game as image discoloration) until the drug's effects have worn off.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006937-medipatchhealingagent.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006937-medipatchhealingagent.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Medipatch Healing Agent</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Medipatch Healing Agent is an antiseptic healing patch that significantly aids in the healing of wounds. Unlike most patches, the Medipatch has no true side effects, though its healing abilities are moderate, happening gradually over time rather than instantaneously. For this reason, it is usually better to use a First Aid Kit in critical situation, especially when the player is still in danger.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006941-reflexreactionaid.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006941-reflexreactionaid.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Reflex Reaction Aid</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Reflex Reaction Aid grants its user with temporary superhuman reflexes. While in effect, the rest of the game world will appear to slow down considerably, giving the hacker additional time to react to enemies. The effects once it has worn off are just as dramatic, as the player will become much more sluggish for a period of time, while the game world will return to normal speed.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006930-geniusmind_enhancer.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006930-geniusmind_enhancer.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Genius Mind-Enhancer</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Genius Mind-Enhancer is a highly specialized tool specifically meant to aid players in overcoming the various puzzle-like mini-games interspersed throughout System Shock. While under the influence of this patch, these puzzles will be easier, though for its duration all left-right player controls will be inverted, meaning that it is critical to ensure that one will not be attacked while using it.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006921-detoxuniversalantidote.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006921-detoxuniversalantidote.png\" height=\"14\" width=\"20\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Detox Universal Antidote</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Detox Universal Antidote serves two roles within the game. The first and primary of its roles is the reduction of the effects of radiation exposure and biological contaminants, while its secondary usage comes in removing the effects of other patches. Since most patches have significant side effects once their benefits have worn off, a simple application of the Detox patch can often quickly curtail any unintended consequences.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Inventory Items</h4><table style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006927-firstaidkit.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006927-firstaidkit.png\" height=\"24\" width=\"60\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>First Aid Kit</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The First Aid Kit is the player's main means of healing outside of the Medipatch, though it is a much more powerful one. It instantaneously renews the hacker to full health, and is the only means of doing so without a healing station. Though inventory space is always tight, it is usually prudent to carry at least a few First Aid Kits on one's person at all times, even when other restoration options are available.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006923-disposablelogicprobe.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006923-disposablelogicprobe.png\" height=\"28\" width=\"14\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Disposable Logic Probe</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Similarly to the Genius Mind-Enhancer, the Disposable Logic Probe is intended to aid the player against the game's wiring/hacking puzzles. However, while the dermal patch simply makes them easier, the Logic Probe bypasses them entirely. While this is certainly handy, given the player's very limited inventory space, it can often be hard to justify carrying them over restorative items, which are useful in more situations.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006917-batterypack.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006917-batterypack.png\" height=\"26\" width=\"28\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Battery Pack</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The energy equivalent of the Medipatch, the Battery Pack immediately restores a small portion of the player's energy reserves. For players that rely on energy weapons or energy-consuming hardware add-ons, they are nice to have, though most levels will also have energy recharge stations (and often more than one), which can somewhat reduce the benefit of lugging batteries around.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2006931-illudium_cadmiumbattery.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/11/118253/2006931-illudium_cadmiumbattery.png\" height=\"26\" width=\"28\" /><br /></a></p></td><td><h3>Illudium-Cadmium Battery</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">If the Battery Pack can be considered a Medipatch energy equivalent, than the Illudium-Cadmium Battery can be thought of as the First Aid Kit of batteries.

Unfortunately, they are exceedingly rare items, and it is likely players will only find a handful of them in the entire game.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Additional Information</h2><ul><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">In the weapon names that use 2 letters followed by a number, the two letters are the initials of many of the developers of the game.</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">System Shock is the first game to feature the code \"451\", which has gone on to appear in many others games that trace their inspirational lineage to System Shock and Looking Glass Studios' simulationist design philosophies in general, including <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/deus-ex/3030-17533\">Deus Ex</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/bioshock/3030-17280\">BioShock</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/dishonored/3030-35850\">Dishonored</a>. In System Shock, this code must be entered by the player to exit the starting room of the game; this code was also the actual security code to unlock the front door of the Looking Glass offices during the time of System Shock's development, and was a reference to Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451.</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">The game's GUI is meant to conceptually represent a computer that has been installed into the player character's brain, and this computer can play computer games. The player can find computer game software scattered about Citadel Station, which can be loaded up in the GUI, letting the player play clones of various other games, including <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/pong/3030-22195\">Pong</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/missile-command/3030-4062\">Missile Command</a> in realtime in a corner of the screen. There is even a simple clone of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/wing-commander/3030-16002\">Wing Commander</a> called Wing 0 that features voice samples licensed from the actual Wing Commander game. The idea to create a playable contextualized clone of Wing Commander inside System Shock was originally a joke written on a white board in the Looking Glass Offices, but a junior programmer misunderstood it as a serious feature request and implemented it.</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">System Shock was released in two versions: a floppy disk version, and later, once CD-ROM drives were more commonplace, a CD version. All of the voice acting, including the first rendition of SHODAN's voice, were exclusive to the CD version. In the floppy version, SHODAN is referred to with the pronoun \"he\", but in the CD version and and the sequel, SHODAN is voiced by a female actress and referred to with the pronoun \"she\".</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">The bridges of light that the player can turn on and off are, as far as some of the game's developers are aware, the first use of dynamic translucent surfaces in any game.</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">There are extensive physics simulations in the game, all coded without using any floating point numbers due to the particular hardware limitations at the time.</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">The game was originally planned for a 12 month development cycle, but ended up taking around 21 months to complete; over the course of development, the project was very nearly cancelled multiple times.</li></ul>", "deck": "Set in a bleak cyberpunk universe, System Shock is a first-person action-adventure game from Looking Glass Studios that challenges players to overcome the hazards of an immense, multi-level space station under the control of an artificial intelligence with aspirations of godhood.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/1/15693/608098-256px_sysshock_1_.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15693/608098-256px_sysshock_1_.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/1/15693/608098-256px_sysshock_1_.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/608098-256px_sysshock_1_.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15693/608098-256px_sysshock_1_.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/1/15693/608098-256px_sysshock_1_.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/15693/608098-256px_sysshock_1_.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/system-shock/3030-13948/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-13948/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": "1994-12-31 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:12:09", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}], "id": 13948, "resource_type": "game", "name": "System Shock"}, "platform": "PC", "title": "System Shock"}

Though, throughout the course of the story, JC finds himself dropped into a larger ideological war involving the <a href=\"/illuminati/3015-2875\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2875\">Illuminati</a>, Majestic-12, and other secret organizations. The future path of humanity is at stake and the game culminates with the player making the ultimate determination of mankind's future by choosing one of three possible scenarios.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><p>Deus Ex plays as a hybrid between a shooter and an RPG. As JC Denton, players can make choices that ultimately alter the course of the main story, both in dialogue and through game actions. The RPG/shooter gameplay supports many different play styles; from run-and-gun, to stealth, to subterfuge. For example, a building might be guarded by robots. Players can choose to sneak past the robots as they patrol in circuit, <a href=\"/lock-picking/3015-2820\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2820\">lock-pick</a> a nearby door to bypass the area the robots patrol, or, of course, go in guns blazing. The same set up might even include an opportunity for both stealth <i>and</i> action-based tactics. Again, for example, the player could stealthily hack gun turrets in order to enter a gun fight with added backup.</p><p>As in some RPGs, players can kill almost any non-critical character in the game. Some major characters may live or die based entirely on the player's decisions. Both of these major RPG features can lead to unique dialogue options, or change future mission objectives.</p><p>Deus Ex uses a grid-based inventory system. The encumbrance of Denton was adjusted for volume of larger items, and density of small items; assault rifles will take a few blocks of space, a rocket launcher will take a few more, but a multiple disarmed explosives can stack on the same block.</p><h2>Improving Your Character</h2><p>A large part of Deus Ex revolves around the ability to improve JC's abilities. There are three notable ways to do this: Augmentation Canisters, Upgrade Canisters, and Skill Points.</p><h3>Augmentation and Upgrade Canisters</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2183/318057-augments.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-318057\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2183/318057-augments.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-318057\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2183/318057-augments.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Augmentation selection screen</figcaption></figure><p>The player can improve Denton's abilities via bio-mechanical augmentation. This is done by collecting canisters and interacting with a medical bot. Denton's body contains a set number of augmentation slots. Each slot may only hold a single canister--containing 2 pre-determined augmentations--and only one of the augmentations can be activated at a time, forcing the player to decide between the two bonuses.</p><p>The augmentation slots are as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Head Augmentations</b></li><li><b>Eye Augmentations</b></li><li><b>Subdermal Augmentations</b></li><li><b>Torso Augmentations</b></li><li><b>Arm Augmentations</b></li><li><b>Leg Augmentations</b></li></ul><p><b>Skill Points</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105098/1716823-deusex_2008_01_25_04_29_28_71.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1716823\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105098/1716823-deusex_2008_01_25_04_29_28_71.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1716823\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105098/1716823-deusex_2008_01_25_04_29_28_71.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/105098/1716823-deusex_2008_01_25_04_29_28_71.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Skill Upgrade Screen</figcaption></figure><p>At the start of each game, the player is allotted a set number of points to be spent on various skills.

The game scored solid to exceptional reviews from some notable gaming outlets, such as an 8.2 from <i><b>GameSpot</b></i>, a 9.4 from <b><i>IGN</i></b>, a 5/5 from <i><b>GamePro</b></i>, and a 88/100 from <i><b>GameSpy</b></i>. Overall the game averaged scores of 90 and 91 as tracked by review aggregate sites <b><i>Metacritic</i></b> and <i><b>Game Rankings</b></i>. It was nominated for over 40 Game of the Year and Best in Class awards by numerous gaming outlets, including <b><i>IG</i></b><i><b>N, GameSpot,</b></i> and <b><i>PC Gamer</i></b>, and is arguably one of the most influential CRPG/shooter hybrids in gaming history.</p><p>Many reviewers repeatedly mentioned a few negative aspects, such as the underwhelming graphics. The voice acting was also criticized, GamePro's Chris Patterson calling it \"truly cheesy.\"</p><h2>PC Requirements</h2><ul><li><b>Operating System</b>: Windows 95/98/Me/XP</li><li><b>Processor</b>: Pentium 300 (Min.), Pentium 450 (Rec.)</li><li><b>Memory</b>: 64 MB RAM (Min.), 128 MB (Rec.)</li><li><b>Video Card</b>: 8MB DirectX 7.0a compatible 3D graphics card (Min.)</li><li><b>Sound Card</b>: DirectX 7.0a compatible sound card</li><li><b>Hard Drive Space</b>: 150 MB (minimum)</li></ul><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>There's an Easter Egg in the Hell's Kitchen map in Deus Ex.

The game is set contemporaneous to the original trilogy, and begins with Katarn stealing the plans to the first <a href=\"/death-star/3035-205\" data-ref-id=\"3035-205\">Death Star</a>. However, from there it branches off into a storyline that is unrelated to the films, detailing Katarn's discovery of the Empire's covert Dark Trooper Project and his subsequent efforts to prevent it from being brought to bear against the Rebel Alliance.</p><p>With the exception of the PlayStation version, which was largely deemed to be inferior, Dark Forces was quite well-received upon its initial release, and its success laid the groundwork for future games in the <a href=\"/star-wars-jedi-knight/3025-554\" data-ref-id=\"3025-554\">Dark Forces/Jedi Knight franchise</a>. Furthermore, certain aspects of its narrative, such as its protagonist, Kyle Katarn, and the concept of Dark Troopers, would become well-known parts of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Its engine, known as the Jedi engine, would also be used for a later LucasArts first-person shooter, <a href=\"/outlaws/3030-1673\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1673\">Outlaws</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Dark Forces was created by a team of twenty developers at LucasArts (not including testers and product support), and took roughly twenty months in total to complete. The project was led by one <a href=\"/daron-stinnett/3040-4413\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4413\">Daron Stinnett</a>, who was hired by LucasArts in 1993 specifically to develop a game for them using the Star Wars license. While Stinnett had originally entertained the idea of a flight simulation game due to his previous flight sim experience working for <a href=\"/spectrum-holobyte-inc/3010-778\" data-ref-id=\"3010-778\">Spectrum Holobyte</a>, the recent success of <a href=\"/id-software/3010-347\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">id Software</a>'s <a href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\">Wolfenstein 3D</a> and the impending release of <a href=\"/doom/3030-7326\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> convinced him to pursue a Star Wars first-person shooter. With the FPS genre still being relatively uncharted territory, Stinnett prioritized raw talent over experience while putting together the development team, even going as far as to hire architectural undergraduates (<a href=\"/ingar-shu/3040-9830\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9830\">Ingar Shu</a> and <a href=\"/matt-tateishi/3040-9841\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9841\">Matt Tateishi</a>) from the University of California at Berkeley as level designers. Stinnett admitted later that the newly-created team, which had neither worked together before nor worked on an FPS, was flying by the seat of its pants in the early goings, saying that \"usually when you develop a game, you have some idea of where you're headed and how to get there. With Dark Forces, we winged it at the beginning\".</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2438046-gromas+16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2438046\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.61875\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2438046-gromas+16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2438046\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2438046-gromas+16.png\"/></a><figcaption>The Jedi engine is capable of simulating environmental effects such as the red haze of the \"Blood Moon,\" Gromas 16.</figcaption></figure><p>The Jedi engine, which is primarily credited to lead programmer <a href=\"/ray-gresko/3040-9828\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9828\">Ray Gresko</a>, took some six months to coalesce into a working state, and realism was one of the main motivations behind its creation. In order to achieve a heightened sense of realism within the game world, the Jedi engine implements truly three-dimensional environments in which rooms can exist on top of one another, something most contemporary FPS engines, like the <a href=\"/id-tech-1/3015-3803\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3803\">Doom engine</a>, were not capable of. The game's programmers also implemented other features that were not common to first-person engines at the time, including the ability to display <a href=\"/polygonal-3d/3015-1430\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">polygonal 3D</a> objects and atmospheric effects such as <a href=\"/fog/3015-904\" data-ref-id=\"3015-904\">fog</a>. In addition, the player's abilities within this game world were intended to match the overall realism of the setting, and thus the ability to jump, crouch, and to look up and down were included.</p><p>In terms of narrative, Dark Forces was originally intended to star <a href=\"/luke-skywalker/3005-1062\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1062\">Luke Skywalker</a>, and its story was to adhere closely to the events of the films. However, the designers quickly began to feel limited by this idea, and it would ultimately be the project's lead artist, <a href=\"/justin-r-chin/3040-3693\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3693\">Justin Chin</a>, who would devise a plotline that branched away from the more well-established fiction of the franchise. Inspired by the setting, he pitched an idea to Stinnett and Gresko involving an elite force of <a href=\"/stormtrooper/3015-2030\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2030\">stormtroopers</a>, and after receiving positive feedback, he quickly put together a design document detailing characters, a story arc, and an outline for thirty-two missions (which would later be pared down to fourteen). In addition to creating the story, Chin was responsible for much of the visual design of the game, both through conceptualization and through hiring and managing the game's other artists. Many of the game's new additions to the Star Wars universe, including weapons and enemies, are attributed primarily to him.</p><p>In order to properly evoke the well-known look and feel of the Star Wars films, the level design team for Dark Forces endeavored to create settings that would feel vibrant and alive when compared to the more abstracted visuals of games like Doom. Various techniques were employed to accomplish this goal; levels in Dark Forces incorporate working machinery like <a href=\"/elevator/3055-550\" data-ref-id=\"3055-550\">elevators</a> and <a href=\"/conveyor-belt/3055-2396\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2396\">conveyor belts</a>, ambient activity such as flowing water and roving mouse droids, and free-moving 3D objects like cargo crates and space ships. In addition to the levels themselves, gameplay also drew significant inspiration from cinema. Chin, who was responsible for mapping out many of the game's puzzles and action sequences, cited the original Star Wars trilogy, <a href=\"/die-hard/3025-149\" data-ref-id=\"3025-149\">Die Hard</a>, and <a href=\"/james-bond/3025-369\" data-ref-id=\"3025-369\">James Bond</a> as inspirations for some of the game's challenges. In point of fact, living up to the movies was of paramount importance to the game's project leader. \"This would be the first time anyone could actually walk around in a Star Wars universe,\" said Stinnett, adding \"It had to have the same rich look and feel and sound and detail of the movies, plus compelling gameplay.\"</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The events of Dark Forces are told from the perspective of Kyle Katarn, a mercenary and ex-Imperial soldier hired by the Rebel Alliance to complete dangerous missions. Before he became affiliated with the Empire or the Alliance, Katarn grew up within a farming community on Sulon and dreamed of becoming a mechanic like his father, <a href=\"/morgan-katarn/3005-740\" data-ref-id=\"3005-740\">Morgan Katarn</a>. While away at the Academy, his home was attacked by Imperial forces, and his parents killed; Katarn, however, believing the Empire's version of events, quickly enlisted in the Imperial Army. It was there that he met <a href=\"/jan-ors/3005-734\" data-ref-id=\"3005-734\">Jan Ors</a>, who was at the time working as a double agent for the Alliance. Sensing a growing discontentment with the Empire, Ors fed Katarn information that revealed to him the truth about the Empire's attack on Sulon, and in return Katarn rescued Ors when her cover was blown, ending both of their tenures in the Empire. Though he did not entirely trust the Alliance, due to his hatred for the Empire and his respect for Ors Katarn began to take on mercenary work for them.</p><p>As Dark Forces begins, Katarn is participating in \"Operation Skyhook,\" a covert mission intended to steal the plans for the Empire's first Death Star from their secret base on Danuta. Katarn is successful in retrieving the plans, and from here the game jumps forward in time to a point after the Battle of Yavin, in which the Death Star was destroyed. Kyle is now called upon by <a href=\"/mon-mothma/3005-6727\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6727\">Mon Mothma</a> to investigate a mysterious development at Tak Base on Talay, which was attacked and destroyed by the Empire with surprising speed. A weapon left behind at the base leads Katarn and Ors, now acting as Katarn's mission officer, to suspect that the attack on Tak Base was related to the Empire's Dark Trooper Project. An inscription on the weapon leads them to a weapon designer named Moff Rebus, who, when confronted, inadvertently tips them off about the existence of an Imperial weapon research facility on Fest. Katarn explores the facility on Fest, and in so doing discovers a sample of a rare metal known as phrik.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2438051-interrogation.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2438051\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2438051-interrogation.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2438051\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2438051-interrogation.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2438051-interrogation.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>As always, the Empire is up to no good.</figcaption></figure><p>Now knowing that phrik is crucial to the production of Dark Troopers, Katarn and Ors track down an Imperial phrik mining operation on Gromas 16. Katarn infiltrates the mine and attaches a sequencer charge to the mine's reactor, allowing him to destroy the entire facility remotely. With the mine destroyed, Kyle turns his attention next to an Imperial detention center on Orinackra where an important spy is being held. Once freed, the spy informs Katarn that the mine he destroyed on Gromas 16 was the first of three production phases for the Dark Trooper Project, with the second being a robotics facility and the third being an imperial ship called the Arc Hammer. By tracking smuggler activity Katarn is able to quickly ascertain the location of the Dark Trooper robotics facility: the ice planet Anteevy. He travels there next, and is able to destroy the operation in short order, once again using sequencer charges to level the entire structure. He then heads to <a href=\"/nar-shaddaa/3035-778\" data-ref-id=\"3035-778\">Nar Shaddaa</a> hoping to obtain further information on smuggling routes.</p><p>Kyle obtains an Imperial navigational card while on Nar Shaddaa, but upon trying to leave, he and Ors are captured by <a href=\"/jabba-the-hutt/3005-1877\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1877\">Jabba the Hutt</a>. Jabba attempts to kill Katarn by feeding him to his pet kell dragons, but Katarn is able to overcome the beasts with his bare hands before escaping with Ors and the nav card. Now with a nav card but no decryption key, Kyle travels to <a href=\"/coruscant/3035-574\" data-ref-id=\"3035-574\">Coruscant</a> to decode the card so that it might lead him closer to the Arc Hammer and the final stage of Dark Trooper production. The decoded card leads him to a refueling station where Katarn absconds with a ship bound for the <a href=\"/executor/3055-624\" data-ref-id=\"3055-624\">Executor</a>, the only ship with knowledge of the Arc Hammer's whereabouts. From there, Kyle sneaks aboard the Arc Hammer via a cargo container and begins the task of destroying the main Dark Trooper production facility. After setting charges, Katarn moves to escape only to be confronted by Gernal Mohc, head of the Dark Trooper Project, in an advanced armor suit. Katarn defeats Mohc and escapes the Arc Hammer as it explodes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2438052-kell+dragon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2438052\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.61875\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/118253/2438052-kell+dragon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2438052\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2438052-kell+dragon.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118253/2438052-kell+dragon.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Kyle Katarn must fight off vicious kell dragons, among other things, in his pursuit of the Dark Trooper Project.</figcaption></figure><p>Dark Forces is a fast-paced first-person action game in the vein of early FPS titles like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. The player moves about a three-dimensional environment from a first-person perspective, using whatever weapons they may have to overcome enemies they encounter as they progress. New weapons are acquired either by taking them from defeated enemies or by finding them within the game world, and ammunition for these weapons can be found in much the same way. Players can increase their survivability and heal wounds by finding shield units and <a href=\"/first-aid-kit/3055-1285\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1285\">med kits</a>, or gain powerful temporary boosts through power-ups, which are often hidden. Certain items may also be used to benefit the player in ways not related to combat; a <a href=\"/flashlight/3055-156\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">head lamp</a> or infrared goggles can be activated to increase visibility, while an <a href=\"/gas-mask/3055-372\" data-ref-id=\"3055-372\">air mask</a> can filter breathable air while in a toxic area. Auxiliary abilities may require constant battery power in order to maintain their use, and if the player expends this power they must obtain batteries to replenish it.</p><p>While the main emphasis of Dark Forces is combat, missions are story-driven, and they are preceded by briefings of the level to come that outline the player's main objectives as well as the narrative impetus for them. Mission objectives often force the player to solve some manner of puzzle in order to proceed or at the very least to be observant of their surroundings. Dark Forces also allows the player to run, jump, crouch, and to look up and down. Depending on the scenario, these different forms of movement and traversal may also be necessary to employ in order to complete a level. Unlike many PC first-person shooters, Dark Forces does not allow the player to save their game while within a mission; instead, the player is given a set number of lives with which to complete a given level. Should the player lose all of their <a href=\"/health/3015-130\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health</a>, they will lose a life and be respawned at a nearby location with 100 hit points and 100 shield points. Should the player lose all of their lives, they can no longer continue, and must restart the level.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Dark Forces includes ten different weapons, many of which possess alternate firing methods. Of particular note is the fact that Dark Forces features shared ammunition types for many of its armaments.

In fact, both Dulin and Firme agreed that the familiar setting increased the game's appeal. Both reviewers were disappointed by Dark Forces' lack of multiplayer as well as certain aspects of its design. Dulin felt that the game was too short, while Firme found a few of the game's levels to be ugly or convoluted.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><p>MS-DOS 5.0, 386DX/33 (rec. 486DX/33), 8MB RAM, 3.5MB on HDD, Compatible Sound Card</p>", "deck": "A 1995 first-person shooter by LucasArts, released for PCs and the PlayStation.

The game starts out with Tavion's apprentice, Alora, infiltrating the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 and stealing a list of areas infused with force energies. New Jedi Jaden Korr sees Alora with some sort of scepter channeling force energy, but is immediately knocked out, and the Dark Jedi flee. Shortly after, Luke Skywalker addresses the new students, assigning them masters, but noting that because there are so few Jedi, multiple padawans will be assigned to each master.</p><p>Jaden is assigned to <a data-ref-id=\"3005-721\" href=\"/kyle-katarn/3005-721\">Kyle Katarn</a>, along with another student, Rosh Penin. Jaden and Rosh both go through some basic training at the academy, where Rosh sets a training droid on Jaden so that Rosh can finish the course first. Jaden defeats it however, and arrives at about the same time as Rosh. After they complete their basic training, both Jedi begin taking on missions with Kyle, although they never work together. After the Jedi have undertaken 4 or 5 missions, Luke Skywalker calls the Jedi back to the academy. He has concluded that the Disciples of Ragnos are somehow funneling the force energy from the places he mentioned in his stolen records. However, he believes there are a few places that may not have been found yet, and dispatches the Jedi to protect them. Jaden is sent to Hoth alone to investigate, while the other Jedi head off to investigate other areas.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/227172-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-227172\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/227172-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-227172\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/227172-12.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Jaden on Hoth</figcaption></figure><p>Jaden lands on Hoth in his Z-95 Headhunter, and initially thinks nothing is out of place, until he spots a path marker through the snow. He hops on a Tauntaun and heads off, following the markers. Shortly, he encounters a picket force of Stormtroopers from the Imperial Remnant, which leads him to believe that the Disciples of Ragnos are on Hoth as well. After fighting his way through the ice plains, and a cave containing a wampa, Jaden reaches the outer fortifications of Echo base, which he infiltrates, successfully avoiding an AT-ST walker.</p><p>Inside Echo base, Jaden encounters both Stormtroopers and cultists, all of whom attempt to stop him. However, after fighting his way through to the command center, Jaden finds a Dark Jedi attempting to slice into the records. Jaden kills him, but seeks out the other cultist in the base who was communicating with the one he just killed. Entering the Echo base hangar, Jaden encounters Alora, a red Twilek, and the Dark Jedi Jaden saw at the Academy. The two engage in a furious lightsaber duel, and when Jaden starts to gain the advantage, Alora uses the force to flee through a hole in the ceiling, telling Jaden that they'll meet again.</p><p>Jaden returns to the academy and passes this information onto Kyle Katarn and Luke Skywalker, who inform Jaden that Rosh never returned from his mission to the planet of Byss. Kyle says he is going to investigate, while Luke leaves the academy to investigate the Disciples of Ragnos further, leaving Jaden to complete his missions on his own. Jaden takes on four or five missions in the meantime, these all much more difficult, as the Disciples of Ragnos are growing more aggressive, and the Jedi are being mobilized to stop them.</p><p>Shortly after this, Master Skywalker called all the Jedi back to the academy, and sent them on missions to investigate places strong in the force that hadn't been mentioned in the stolen records. Due to the loss of Rosh, the Jedi were to work in pairs on these missions. Jaden and Kyle were selected to investigate Vader's Bast Castle on the planet Vjun.</p><p>Upon arriving on Vjun, the pair encountered a hostile environment, with acid rain falling from the sky and heavy, suited environment troopers armed with Concussion Rifles. The two Jedi fought their way through the canyons surrounding the perimeter of Bast Castle, facing Imperial troops along the way. However, they were stopped from entering the actual castle by a pair of TIE Bombers carpet-bombing the entrance, keeping them from entering. Jaden and Kyle entered a nearby structure, where Jaden fought a Reborn, before entering a mounted turret which he used to shoot down the TIE Bombers. With the pathway clear, the duo made their way to the entrance of Bast Castle, and infiltrated the lower levels by jumping into a garbage chute.</p><p>Jaden and Kyle split up in order to infiltrate the castle, working their way from the lower levels occupied only by weak Imperial forces, to the upper echelons where the Disciples of Ragnos are. When Jaden overloaded a machine by feeding the energy it was producing back into it, part of the ceiling collapsed, knocking Kyle down a long pit. He managed to survive the fall, but Jaden was forced to go on alone while Kyle worked his way back up again.</p><p>Fighting through the upper levels of Bast Castle, Jaden encountered many Reborn and Dark Jedi. After fighting through to the top level of the Castle, Jaden encountered old friend Rosh Penin, who had succumbed to the lure of the Dark Side and was working alongside Tavion to siphon the force energies of the castle. Jaden battles with Rosh and the Kothos Twins, eventually dispatching the Twins and disarming Rosh. Shortly after, Kyle arrived on the scene. However, Tavion disabled Jaden and Kyle with Force Lightning, used the Scepter of Ragnos along with Jaden's lightsaber to bring down the entire room around them and escaped with Rosh in tow. Thanks to Kyle's quick reaction, Jaden and Kyle were able to escape safely as well.</p><p>Upon returning to the Jedi Academy, Jaden was promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight in light of his actions on Vjun. After building a new lightsaber to replace the one that was lost on Vjun, Jaden then set out to accomplish more missions.</p><p>Jaden was then called back to the Academy and informed by Luke that he was to be part of a Jedi Strike team to prevent the Disciples of Ragnos from resurrecting Marka Ragnos on Korriban. Before Jaden could set out however, Kyle informed him that he had received a transmission from Rosh stating that he wished to return to the Jedi Order. Thus the two of them went to Taspir III in order to rescue Rosh from the cult.</p><p>After fighting through the cult members that were in the base, Jaden finally reached Rosh and discovered him to be unharmed and walking freely. Jaden immediately assumed that it was a trap and his anger flared, readying his lightsaber for combat. Before he struck Rosh, Kyle sensed Jaden's situation and mentally warned him not to let his anger get the better of him.</p><p><b>(At this point the story diverges according to the player's choice of action. Star Wars canon states that Jaden let Rosh live)</b></p><p>Jaden eventually let go of his anger and forgave Rosh, deactivating his lightsaber. Upon seeing this, Alora, who had been observing from above, leaped down and struck Rosh, dismembering his left arm. Jaden then proceeded to engage Alora in combat and emerged victorious after a grueling battle. After Kyle arrived on the scene to tend to Rosh's safety, Jaden went on ahead to Korriban to join with the other Jedi.</p><p>He fought his way through the legions of Disciples alongside his fellow Jedi and finally reached the tomb of Marka Ragnos where he confronted Tavion before she had revived Ragnos. Tavion fought with all the power of the Dark Side, even using the Scepter of Ragnos to feed off of its energies. Eventually however she was bested by Jaden, at which point she attempted to resurrect the spirit of Marka Ragnos who then possessed Tavion's body. After another prolonged duel, Jaden managed to destroy the Scepter, thus forcing Ragnos to leave Tavion's body. Tavion died shortly after due to her body not being able to withstand the corruption caused my Ragnos. Jaden then left the tomb and sealed it, meeting Luke and Kyle on the steps to the tomb, where Luke proclaimed Jaden to be a true Jedi Knight.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Jedi Academy built on the work done in Jedi Outcast, and included an online multiplayer component with five modes, including two completely new gametypes.

If multiple people were in a room, whoever wins the duel continues playing, while the loser has to wait again for another turn.</li><li>Power Duel: A variant of the duel mode, Power Duel saw a 2v1 setup, where two lesser powered players would attempt to take on one player with more Force and saber skills, attempting to eliminate him.</li><li>Siege: A unique mode to Jedi Academy, siege is a class-based objective mode, effectively making it an independent beast from the rest of Jedi Academy's multiplayer modes which all use the same basic template. Siege allows you to choose from a variety of classes, each of which have unique weaponry and abilities, and only one of which can use a lightsaber. Your team must work to either complete or prevent the completion of a set of objectives throughout the map. When the attacking team achieves an objective, the defending team is pushed back to a new location, where they have a new objective to protect, meaning the game will generally change scenery over the course of the game.</li><li>Capture the flag: A standard CTF variant. Flags touch return and your flag must be at your home base before you can score the enemie's flag.</li></ul><h3>Multiplayer Characters</h3><p>The game included a large list of multiplayer character models, including the ability for you to import your single-player Jaden model.

The result is an RPG with many of the most common Star Wars themes, such as good versus evil, and tropes (everything from starships to <a href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70\" data-ref-id=\"3055-70\">lightsabers</a> are present).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>KOTOR's gameplay consists of two parts, combat and dialog. The combat is <a href=\"/turn-based/3015-192\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn based</a>, although the animations give the illusion of <a href=\"/real-time-combat/3015-2332\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\">real-time combat</a>. The player may pause the game at any point during combat to get their bearings and rethink their strategy. The combat is based on Wizard of the Coast's d20 system. Your character may be equipped with a long-range weapon such as a <a href=\"/blaster/3055-478\" data-ref-id=\"3055-478\">blaster</a>, or a short-range weapon such as a <a href=\"/sword/3055-1\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">sword</a> or a <a href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70\" data-ref-id=\"3055-70\">lightsaber</a>. In addition to your weapons, you can use force powers that your character has learned throughout the course of the game, as well as those of your companions. Special combat moves such as \"Flurry\" may be activated at any time during combat, which will increase your attack speed, your damage, or your chance of dealing a critical hit. To unlock abilities such as these, one must earn them through points gained by leveling up. There is a good variety of abilities and there are many options for customizing a character to fit the desires of the player.</p><p>The other half of gameplay is the dialog where you interact with the NPC's through complex <a href=\"/dialogue-trees/3015-77\" data-ref-id=\"3015-77\">dialog trees</a>. The game allows for a wide range of <a href=\"/moral-decisions/3015-93\" data-ref-id=\"3015-93\">moral choices</a> and options so that even after multiple playthroughs new content may still be discovered. The player is encouraged to build an emotional connection with their companions by learning their back-stories and potentially even fall in love with them. The game tracks the player's choices throughout the game to determine their alignment to either the dark or light side. The player's alignment can alter the appearance of their character, and affects how companions react to you. All characters in KOTOR are voiced with exception of the main character, who remains unheard during dialogue sequences, though the player may hear numerous grunts and battles cries during combat.</p><h3>Character Creation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/596651-facesoffemrevans.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596651\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 190px\" data-ratio=\"1.6789473684211\" data-width=\"190\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/596651-facesoffemrevans.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596651\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/596651-facesoffemrevans.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Female character faces</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/596652-facesofrevan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596652\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 190px\" data-ratio=\"1.6789473684211\" data-width=\"190\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/596652-facesofrevan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596652\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/596652-facesofrevan.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/596652-facesofrevan.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Male character faces</figcaption></figure><p>The main character in KOTOR has a <a href=\"/customizable-characters/3015-155\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">customizable appearance</a> and skillset, with the ability to be either male or female at the outset, as well as the choice of three player classes.

The Jedi Council refused to allow Jedi to fight in the war with the Mandalorians which was going badly. A small group of Jedi, led by <a href=\"/darth-revan/3005-959\" data-ref-id=\"3005-959\">Revan</a> and <a href=\"/darth-malak/3005-1048\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1048\">Malak</a>, left to fight in the war anyway. Through their actions, they turned the tide of the war and won it, becoming heroes in the process. For reasons unknown at the time, Revan and Malak left known space leaving no traces. They returned as <a href=\"/sith/3015-1407\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1407\">Sith</a> and waged war against what remained of the Republic. In a moment of desperation, a Jedi strike force led by Jedi Knight <a href=\"/bastila-shan/3005-846\" data-ref-id=\"3005-846\">Bastila Shan</a> succeeded in boarding <a href=\"/darth-revan/3005-959\" data-ref-id=\"3005-959\">Revan's</a> ship but before he could be captured, Malak fired on his own master. The game opens as the Republic is on the verge of defeat by Malak's seemingly limitless forces.</p><blockquote><p>Four thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Republic verges on collapse. DARTH MALAK, last surviving apprentice of the Dark Lord Revan, has unleashed an invincible <a href=\"/sith/3015-1407\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1407\">Sith</a> armada upon an unsuspecting galaxy.</p><p>Crushing all resistance, Malak's <a href=\"/great-jedi-purge/3015-3776\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3776\">war of conquest</a> has left the Jedi Order scattered and vulnerable as countless Knights fall in battle, and many more swear allegiance to the new <a href=\"/sith/3015-1407\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1407\">Sith</a> Master.</p><p>In the skies above the <a href=\"/outer-rim/3035-2059\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2059\">Outer Rim</a> world of Taris, a Jedi battle fleet engages the forces of Darth Malak in a desperate effort to halt the Sith's galactic domination\u2026</p><cite>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Opening Crawl</cite></blockquote><p>After escaping from the tutorial area, players will learn of their Force-sensitivity, and begin training as a Jedi, under the tutelage of the Jedi masters on Dantooine. While learning the ways of the Force, the player will begin to have shared visions with Bastilla of mysterious ruins on the planet's surface, which they are sent to investigate. Here, they discover an ancient Rakatan Star Map, which alludes to something that Revan and Malak found called \"The Star Forge\". Fearing that the star forge is a weapon, Bastilla and the player analyze the Star map, noting several other planets which should have Star Maps on them, according to the original. After speaking to the Jedi Council, the pair is assigned to re-assemble the Star Map and ascertain the location of the <a href=\"/the-star-forge/3035-367\" data-ref-id=\"3035-367\">Star Forge</a>, so that the republic may destroy it. Setting off from Dantooine in the Ebon Hawk with the allies they gathered on Taris, the pair heads off in search of more Star Maps. The various Star Maps are located across various planets, which can be done in whatever order the player chooses, although set events will always happen on the player's first and third planets. </p><h3>Plot Twist</h3><p>While KOTOR is known for it's gameplay and remarkable story, it is also known to have one of the most unseen and best plot twists in any video game. In the closing hours of the main character's campaign, it is revealed to you that the player controlled character is not just a random soldier/scoundrel/scout but rather <a href=\"/darth-revan/3005-959\" data-ref-id=\"3005-959\">Darth Revan</a>, a dark lord of the <a href=\"/sith/3015-1407\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1407\">Sith</a>, and former master to the antagonist, <a href=\"/darth-malak/3005-1048\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1048\">Darth Malak</a>. Hints are dropped throughout the game, which you fully understand once playing through it again.</p><p>It is explained that the Jedi used the Force to wipe the main character's mind completely clean of knowledge of their past, and the knowledge of the Dark Side of the Force, and the Sith ways of using the force.</p><p>When this occurs, the player must choose how they receive this news. They can either choose to follow their dark past, or try to redeem themselves with the Light Side and Jedi. The canon path is the path of redemption (light side path).</p><h2>Planets</h2><p>KOTOR has several large planets populated with interactive NPC's that serve as the backdrop for the game.

This sequel, <a href=\"/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords/3030-8852\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8852\">The Sith Lords</a>, was not handled by Bioware, but instead by <a href=\"/obsidian-entertainment/3010-1520\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1520\">Obsidian Entertainment</a>. This sequel was generally well-regarded, but was often criticized for its lack of polish and lackluster ending, both the results of a rushed production schedule. Large portions of the game, including a whole planet and many more options on Malachor were excised from the game at the last minute due to deadline concerns. Obsidian included many of the cut assets on the PC game disc, allowing mod teams to recreate the content they were forced to cut. The gameplay was greatly improved, but most players simply did not regard KOTOR II as highly as they did with the original.</p><p>Rumors circulated that BioWare would be making a Knights of the Old Republic MMO. On the last day of E3 2008, <a href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts</a> CEO, <a href=\"/john-riccitiello/3040-65707\" data-ref-id=\"3040-65707\">John Riccitiello</a> made several comments about a KOTOR MMO, suggesting that it had been the MMO Bioware had been working on. On October 21, 2008, Bioware and <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts</a> officially announced <a href=\"/star-wars-the-old-republic/3030-24205\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24205\">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>, the much rumored KOTOR MMO. <a href=\"/star-wars-the-old-republic/3030-24205\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24205\">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> was released on the December 20, 2011 in North America and Europe, for PC only. The game takes place 300 years after the original Knights of the Old Republic series, and takes place aproxamitly 3,600 years before '<a href=\"/star-wars/3025-551\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars: Episodes I-VI</a>'.</p><h2>Cut Content</h2><p>Although the cut content in the original Knights of the Old Republic was not as significant as the content that had to be cut from The Sith Lords, a few things were, including one planet that was mentioned in pre-release videos, a dark side romance option, and a brief encounter with Dead-Eye Duncan on Manaan.</p><p>The planet, called Sleyheron, was going to be a volcanic world controlled by the Hutts, a slaving center. This planet was supposed to have a Star Map on it, but was likely removed early in the development process to allow Bioware to focus more on their other five main planets. The planet Sleyheron is briefly mentioned in the game on Korriban by Yuthura Ban. It is also mentioned in a side-quest in KOTOR II, where Vogga the Hutt agrees to ship some of his fuel reserves from Sleyheron to Citadel Station, above Telos IV.</p><p>Also cut was an option for female Dark Side players who had fallen in love with Carth to repent at the very end of the game. After defeating Malak, Carth would board the Star Forge alone and convince Revan to give up her dark ways. Revan would kill Bastila, and remain with Carth aboard the Star Forge as the Republic forces destroyed it. In this ending, the Ebon Hawk would be destroyed, and all of her crew would be dead by the end of the game. This ending has been recreated via fan-made mods for the PC release of KOTOR.</p><p>The other known piece of cut content is on Manaan. If the player defeats Bendak Starkiller in the deathmatch on Taris, later on Manaan, Dead-Eye Duncan will appear in the hangar, having escaped the destruction of Taris, and will ask if he can use your duelist name from Taris, The Mysterious Stranger. This has also been re-created via PC mods.</p><p>Also, an early development idea was for there to be a subplot involving clones in KOTOR, but the idea was nixed by LucasArts so that KOTOR would not steal the thunder from the upcoming 'Attack of the Clones' film.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li>Windows 98 / 98SE / ME / 2000 / XP / 7</li><li>Intel Pentium III 1.00 GHz or AMD Athlon 1.00 GHz</li><li>128 MB RAM required for Windows 98, 256 MB RAM required for Windows ME/2000/XP</li><li>32 MB OpenGL 1.4 compatible PCI or AGP</li><li>DirectX 9.0b compatible Audio Device required</li><li>4.0 GB of free hard drive space required</li><li>4X Speed CD-ROM drive required</li><li>Keyboard and mouse required</li></ul><p><i>*3D Transform Lighting (T&amp;L) Capability required</i></p><p><i>**Microsoft DirectX 9.0b is included on this CD.</i></p><h3><b>Recommended</b></h3><ul><li>1.60 GHZ AMD or equivalent Intel processor</li><li>ATI Radeon 9200 or better, NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti or better</li><li>512 MB RAM</li></ul><h3>Supported Chipsets</h3><ul><li>ATI Radeon 8500 / 9000 / 9200 / 9500 / 9600 / 9700 / 9800</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 FX family</li></ul>", "deck": "Star Wars: KOTOR is a role-playing game set 4000 years before \"A New Hope,\" featuring a Republic soldier who fights to stop Darth Malak and the Sith fleet from destroying the Republic.

It was the first series to incorporate slow motion <a href=\"/bullet-time/3015-78\" data-ref-id=\"3015-78\">bullet time</a> into the gameplay. With a tap of the button, time slows down for Max's enemies while his reaction abilities remain the same. Max can also leap in any direction in slow motion whilst firing his guns, which is called a shoot dodge. Entering bullet time drains the hour glass meter but, unlike the first game, the meter regenerates on its own given enough time. Dubbed 'Bullet Time 2.0', the meter no longer drains while shoot dodging and killing several enemies in quick succession is rewarded with a bullet time reload involving Max ducking while the camera spins around him.</p><h2><b>Plot</b></h2><p><a href=\"/max-payne/3005-697\" data-ref-id=\"3005-697\">Max Payne</a> 2 is a mature <a href=\"/film-noir/3015-1732\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1732\">film noir</a> love story. It deals with themes like love, depression and choices. Following the story of the first game, Max is now a detective for the NYPD, having been cleared of the charges he faced thanks to <a href=\"/alfred-woden/3005-4129\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4129\">Alfred Woden</a>. He is still suffering from depression over his wife and daughter's murder and has turned to <a href=\"/alcoholic-beverages/3055-698\" data-ref-id=\"3055-698\">alcohol</a>. When investigating a shots fired call, he runs into a gang of heavily armed men disguised as cleaners. Along the way, he runs into <a href=\"/mona-sax/3005-1129\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1129\">Mona Sax</a>, but she disappears before he can get to her. The cleaners escape the scene. Mona later comes to Max's apartment to tell him someone wants them both dead, shortly after which a sniper tries to kill them. Mona runs off on her own and Max fights the cleaners in his apartment building. They blow up his apartment.</p><p>This time, Max approaches Mona in a run-down amusement park, which she has made her home. She tells him about a possible lead, a member of the Inner Circle, a group of powerful men. However, by the time they arrive he is already dead and the cleaners are all over the building. When the police arrive, they arrest Mona. Back at the precinct, the cleaners have assaulted the building trying to kill Mona. Max manages to follow them in one of their own vans and they arrive at a <a href=\"/construction-site/3035-2393\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2393\">construction site</a>, where Mona soon joins him. The cleaners have a huge arsenal of weapons hidden on the site. <a href=\"/valerie-winterson/3005-4131\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4131\">Winterson</a>, another detective, confronts Max and threatens to shoot Mona. Max shoots her first, but she manages to shoot Max when she is on the ground.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1480/312302-max_payne_2_graphic_novel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-312302\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1480/312302-max_payne_2_graphic_novel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-312302\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1480/312302-max_payne_2_graphic_novel.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Max Payne 2's story is mostly told through graphic novel vignettes.</figcaption></figure><p>Max wakes up in the hospital and finds Winterson dead. The cleaners, this time without their disguises, try to kill him once more. Max escapes the hospital and returns to the <a href=\"/amusement-park/3035-1755\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1755\">amusement park</a>, only to find his enemies waiting for him there. He is confronted by <a href=\"/vladimir-lem/3005-2933\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2933\">Vlad</a>, an old friend, who turns out to be the leader of the cleaners. Vlad shoots Max and blows up the amusement park. Mona makes her way through the burning park and arrives just in time to rescue Max, who survived the shot.</p><p>They find out Vlad is after all members of the Inner Circle so he can take control of the group and seize power. At Alfred Woden's mansion, Mona reveals she was working for him all along and was hired to kill Max, but she couldn't do it. However, Vlad appears and shoots her, before setting off charges in the building and killing Woden. Max resolves to end this once and for all and sets out to kill Vlad. He chases him through the mansion, dispatching his henchmen along the way, and confronts him on the roof over a skylight. Vlad has the high ground and throws <a href=\"/molotov-cocktail/3055-75\" data-ref-id=\"3055-75\">molotov cocktails</a> at Max, but Max manages to shoot out the platform he is standing on and Vlad falls to his death, burning because of his own molotovs.</p><p>Max returns to Mona just in time to hear her last words: \"God, I turned out to be such a <a href=\"/damsel-in-distress/3015-100\" data-ref-id=\"3015-100\">damsel in distress</a>.\" He kisses her, and she dies, but Max has put the demons of his past to rest. If playing the game under Dead on Arrival difficulty, Mona lives in an alternate ending.</p><h2><b>Characters</b></h2><h3><a href=\"/max-payne/3005-697\" data-ref-id=\"3005-697\"><b>Max Payne</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/211706-screen18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-211706\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/211706-screen18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-211706\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/211706-screen18.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/211706-screen18.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Max and Mona</figcaption></figure><p>Having walked free after the events of the first game due to the influence of <a href=\"/alfred-woden/3005-4129\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4129\">Alfred Woden</a>, Max is once again back on the force as a detective for the NYPD. Still haunted by his inner demons and unable to forget losing his wife and daughter, he is thrust once again into the criminal underworld. Max remains introverted and deeply thoughtful about the events that unfold in the second game, constantly expressing his situation and feelings with clever and complex metaphors. The actual in game character is different from the one seen in the first game. In the original Max Payne, the 3D model was based off <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sami-jarvi/3040-47155\" data-ref-id=\"3040-47155\">Sam Lake</a>,  while in the sequel the developers were able to hire professional actors, choosing <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/timothy-gibbs/3040-98134\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98134\">Timothy Gibbs</a> to be the new model for Max.</p><h3><a href=\"/mona-sax/3005-1129\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1129\"><b>Mona Sax</b></a></h3><p>A killer who used to work for the mob, presumably killed in the previous game. She resurfaces, hired to kill Vladimir Lem by Alfred Woden. However, Vladimir Lem has sent his \"cleaners\" after her. She develops a relationship with Max, as they both lived through the events of the first game. She is a suspect in the murder of a senator. She may or may not have a bullet lodged somewhere in her body. She revealed she was also instructed to kill Max. During the latter stages of the game Mona becomes a playable character and portions of the story told from Max's perspective are revisited from the point of view of Mona.</p><h3><a href=\"/vladimir-lem/3005-2933\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2933\"><b>Vladimir Lem</b></a></h3><p>A one-time Russian mob boss who has allegedly cleaned up his act and started a legitimate business, Club Vodka, a restaurant. In truth he is plotting to wipe out the competing Italian gang and the Inner Circle so he can take it over and control the city's underworld. Tries to have Max and Mona killed and controls the gang of hitmen disguised as cleaners. By the resolution of the game Vlad is revealed to be the power hungry former protege of Alfred Woden.</p><h3><a href=\"/vinnie-gognitti/3005-3628\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3628\"><b>Vinnie Gognitti</b></a></h3><p>Leader of the Italian mafia, rival to Vlad's own gang. A fan and collector of Captain Baseball Bat Boy memorabilia. First seen in the previous game, where Max left him wounded in an alley. He was killed by Vlad while wearing a Captain Baseball Bat Boy suit with a bomb in it which Vlad detonated.</p><h3><a href=\"/alfred-woden/3005-4129\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4129\"><b>Alfred Woden</b></a></h3><p>The last remaining member of the Inner Circle, Alfred Woden has ties to the murdered senator and other influential people. He hired Mona to kill Max, Vladimir and anyone else tied to the Inner Circle in order to preserve his power base.</p><h3><a href=\"/valerie-winterson/3005-4131\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4131\"><b>Detective Valerie Winterson</b></a></h3><p>Single mother to a blind child and Vladimir's mistress, which is how she was constantly one step ahead of the police. She agreed to kill Max and Mona for Vlad, but was shot by Max and died in the hospital. Valerie at times acts as a foil for Max's character; she is rational and does things by the book, qualities that Max admires but ultimately create conflict between the two detectives.</p><h3><a href=\"/jim-bravura/3005-4134\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4134\"><b>Lieutenant Jim Bravura</b></a></h3><p>Max's commanding officer who arrested him at the end of the first game. A former alcoholic. He assigns Max to a desk job because he aided Mona, a fugitive. Jim attempts to empathize with Max's emotional and mental state by encouraging him to attend AA meetings. He gets shot in the hospital as Vlad's men try to kill Max, but survives the attack.</p><h2>Themes</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8879/234507-mp2_photograph_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234507\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2222222222222\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8879/234507-mp2_photograph_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234507\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8879/234507-mp2_photograph_07.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8879/234507-mp2_photograph_07.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The real life actors posing</figcaption></figure><p>The game carries the moniker 'A <a href=\"/film-noir/3015-1732\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1732\">Film Noir</a> Love Story' and it is suitably set up to deliver these codes and conventions. Visually the game is gritty and dark, featuring many low key lit locations that allow the extensive use of shadows. The in-game graphic novels are also a perfect example of conventional film noir visuals. Max's face is frequently covered in shadows during the graphic novels helping externalize his deeply troubled feelings.</p><p>Structurally, the game also plays to film noir conventions. For example, the game begins in media res and makes extensive use of flashbacks and internalization (Max's dreams). The story also features many <a href=\"/plot-twist/3015-442\" data-ref-id=\"3015-442\">plot twists</a> and conspiracies, also a staple of film noir.</p><p>As for character types, the game suitably fulfills these as well. Max Payne is a brooding detective whose monologues are deep and thought provoking, while Mona Sax is the stock <a href=\"/femme-fatale/3015-1898\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1898\">femme fatale</a> who acts as Max's love interest but also provides further twists to the complex story.</p><p>When you beat the game, the song in the background is called \"Late Goodbye\" by Poets of the Fall.</p><h2>Story Chapters</h2><p><b>Part I: The Darkness Inside</b></p><ol><li>Elevator Doors</li><li>A Criminal Mastermind</li><li>The Depths of My Brain</li><li>No \"Us\" in This</li><li>A Sign of Her Passage</li><li>A Linear Sequence of Scares</li><li>The Million Dollar Question</li></ol><p><b>Part II: A Binary Choice</b></p><ol><li>The Things That I Want</li><li>In the Middle of Something</li><li>Blowing Up</li><li>Routing Her Synapses</li><li>Out of the Window</li><li>The Genius of the Hole</li></ol><p><b>Part III: Waking Up from the American Dream</b></p><ol><li>Too Stubborn to Die</li><li>On a Crash Course</li><li>A Mob-War</li><li>Dearest of All My Friends</li><li>A Losing Game</li><li>There Are No Happy Endings</li><li>Love Hurts</li><li>That Old Familiar Feeling</li></ol><h2>Modes and Features</h2><p>As well as the standard story mode, the game also has a new mode and a new feature.</p><h3>Previously</h3><p>Located in the main menu, this mode recaps the story from the original Max Payne using a series of graphic novels.</p><h3>Jump to Chapter</h3><p>After completing the game, the player can start a new game and choose any chapter from the story mode.</p><h3>Dead Man Walking</h3><p>This mode places the player in an enclosed space surrounded by enemy spawn points. The aim of this mode is to stay alive as long as possible while killing the waves of enemies that continuously appear. The mode starts out with a single enemy and further enemies are introduced, escalating in difficulty.</p><h3>New York Minute</h3><p>The speed-run mode. The aim here is to complete each chapter in the fastest possible time. Each chapter starts with a timer that counts upward; killing enemies reduces the time as does using bullet time. This mode is a revamp of the New York Minute mode in the original Max Payne where players had to complete a level before the timer ran down.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>9mm Pistol</h3><p>A simple handgun which is very reliable. It has 16 rounds and a medium rate of fire. It works well in most situations and, if dual-wielded, can be very effective in dispatching most enemies standing in Max's way.</p><h3><a href=\"/desert-eagle/3055-90\" data-ref-id=\"3055-90\"><b>Desert Eagle</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/182153-maxpayne2_004_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182153\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1550/182153-maxpayne2_004_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182153\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/182153-maxpayne2_004_large.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1550/182153-maxpayne2_004_large.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Mona Sax shooting dual desert eagles.</figcaption></figure><p>A more powerful handgun. It has fewer rounds than the 9mm at 10 and also has a slow rate of fire. The advantage of the gun is that it is more powerful than the 9mm and, when dual-wielded, can clear out a room very quickly.</p><h3><a href=\"/mp5/3055-289\" data-ref-id=\"3055-289\"><b>MP5</b></a></h3><p>A good gun for most situations. Has a very high rate of fire and large clip size of 30. It also has a scope, which makes it more useful for long-range targets. With bullet time enabled, the MP5 can become a low-class sniper rifle with its faster rate of fire.</p><h3>Ingram</h3><p>The Ingram is the fastest weapon in the game with a phenomenal rate of fire and huge clip size of 32. The downside is that the gun is very inaccurate and is not good for precision aiming. The gun is most useful in clearing out rooms and with bullet time enabled you can aim more easily.</p><h3><a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\"><b>Pump-Action Shotgun</b></a></h3><p>The most basic shotgun in the game. It has a clip size of 7 and a medium firing rate. The gun is most effective at close range and against enemies who are grouped together.</p><h3>Striker</h3><p>A very powerful weapon. It has a fast rate of fire and a relatively large clip size of 10. The gun also has a large spread which again makes it useful against packs of enemies.</p><h3><a href=\"/sawed-off-shotgun/3055-1993\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1993\"><b>Sawed-off Shotgun</b></a></h3><p>The sawed-off is a quick burst of power. It has small clip size of 2, but a fast rate of fire and reload time. It is best used while taking heat from a group of enemies and you need a quick breather. Use this to blast them away and get to some cover.</p><h3><a href=\"/grenade/3055-111\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\"><b>Grenade</b></a></h3><p>As simple as the name suggests. Grenades can cause havoc in groups of enemies or, if you're really cruel, a poor man on his own.</p><h3><a href=\"/molotov-cocktail/3055-75\" data-ref-id=\"3055-75\"><b>Molotov Cocktail</b></a></h3><p>Another explosive weapon. This weapon can cause a good fire and is useful when taking fire behind some cover. Just toss this over your head and watch the enemies sizzle.</p><h3><a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\"><b>Sniper Rifle</b></a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/233210-screen15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-233210\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/233210-screen15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-233210\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/233210-screen15.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/233210-screen15.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Max with a Sniper Rifle</figcaption></figure><p>A basic sniper rifle. It can hold 5 rounds at once and has a slow firing rate. Best used from long range and can cause a kill in a single shot.</p><h3>Drugunov</h3><p>A more advanced sniper rifle. Has a larger clip size than the basic sniper at 10. Only really useful in long range situations but again can get you one shot kills.</p><h3><a href=\"/m4-carbine/3055-622\" data-ref-id=\"3055-622\"><b>M4 Carbine</b></a></h3><p>A nice powerful assault rifle. Fires quickly and can hold 30 rounds. Not much ammo for the gun in the game so it is best used sparingly. Can get a one shot kill to the head.</p><h3>Kalashnikov</h3><p>Similar to the M4 but with more ammo available. Has a clip size of 30 and a fast rate of fire. Useful in almost every situation in the game and packs a reasonable punch.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p><i>As displayed on the box</i>*Supported Operating Systems are:</p><ul><li>Windows 98 ( and Windows 98 Second Edition).</li><li>Windows Millennium.</li><li>Windows 2000 Professional (Workstation, Service Pack 3 required).</li><li>Windows XP (Home and Professional, Service Pack 1 required).</li></ul><h3>Generic Requirements</h3><ul><li>1.7GB Hard Drive space</li><li>Windows 98 / ME / 2000 / XP.</li><li>DirectX 9.0.</li><li>Mouse and Keyboard.</li></ul><h3>Minimum System Requirements</h3><ul><li><b>CPU (Processor):</b> 1GHz Pentium 3 / Athlon or 1.2GHz Celeron or Duron processor.</li><li><b>RAM:</b> 256MB.</li><li><b>GPU (Video Card):</b> 32MB DirectX 9 compatible AGP graphics card with hardware transform and lighting support.</li></ul><h3>Recommended System Requirements</h3><ul><li><b>CPU (Processor):</b> 1.4GHz Athlon or 1.7GHz Pentium 4, Celeron or Duron processor.</li><li><b>RAM:</b> 512MB.</li><li><b>GPU (Video Card):</b> 64MB DirectX 9 compatible AGP graphics card with hardware transform and lighting support.</li></ul><h2>Xbox Originals</h2><p>On April 27, 2009, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne became available on the Xbox 360's Xbox Originals service for 1200 Microsoft Points.</p>", "deck": "Max Payne 2 is a film-noir action game in which the player takes control of Max Payne, in search of the murdering group masquerading as cleaners.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2737112-maxpayne2.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2737112-maxpayne2.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2737112-maxpayne2.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2737112-maxpayne2.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2737112-maxpayne2.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2737112-maxpayne2.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2737112-maxpayne2.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne/3030-3547/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-3547/", "number_of_user_reviews": 12, "original_release_date": "2003-10-15 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-5/", "id": 5, "name": "BBFC: 15"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-16/", "id": 16, "name": "ESRB: M"}], "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:46:04", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-19/", "abbreviation": "PS2", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19/", "id": 19, "name": "PlayStation 2"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-32/", "abbreviation": "XBOX", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox/3045-32/", "id": 32, "name": "Xbox"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}], "id": 3547, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne"}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Max Payne 2"}

Players are also able to use items to help the party in various way such as refiling health and shields or increasing the damage of all weapons for one turn. The game then resumes the action with the party firing their weapons automatically and players have to move the party up and down to dodge incoming missiles and enemies in melee range. After five seconds the action freezes again to allow players to switch weapons and adjust their aim before resuming. This cycle repeats until either Sam's party is knocked out or all enemies are defeated.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Many of the weapons iconic to the Serious Sam games are included in The Random Encounter.

Many missions consist of only a single type, but some make use of all three. All three gameplay types are also available for <a href=\"/split-screen-multiplayer/3015-322\" data-ref-id=\"3015-322\">multiplayer</a>. Each mission is completely linear, not unlike previous Star Fox titles.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/366869-00121143.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366869\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/366869-00121143.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366869\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/366869-00121143.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Fox in one of the on-foot portions</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Arwing missions follow the same gameplay type as previous Star Fox games. Some missions are on-rails, with players defeating enemies in a certain level with a mandatory boss fight at the end. Other missions are in a small area where the player has a full freedom of movement, usually with certain objectives such as destroying certain Aparoid spawning points. Occasionally during missions, Fox's wingmates will be chased by an enemy, causing them to call for help. In some levels, Fox even has the option to jump out of the Arwing to explore on-foot (and possibly even jumping into a Landmaster).</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On-foot and Landmaster portions of the game are all portions that give the player full freedom of movement. When playing on-foot, the game is essentially a third-person shooter. The player can pick up weapons such as a <a href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608\" data-ref-id=\"3055-608\">Machine Gun</a> and a Homing Launcher, which can be switched on the fly. As with the Arwing missions, the player can aid their wingmates, but from the ground instead. In two levels, Fox is on the wings of an Arwing or Wolfen picking off enemies on the ground with a <a href=\"/plasma-cannon/3055-1062\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1062\">Plasma Cannon</a>.</p><h3>Multiplayer</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/875543-561297_20040511_screen021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875543\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/875543-561297_20040511_screen021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875543\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/875543-561297_20040511_screen021.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/875543-561297_20040511_screen021.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiplayer can take place on many stages, including this one.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Star Fox Assault has multiplayer support for up to four players (2-4). The multiplayer mode is very similar to an open action mission in the single-player campaign. In multiplayer games, however, instead of battling enemy opponents, it is other players. Multiplayer starts out very limited, but there can be much more unlocked, such as playable characters, <a href=\"/maps/3015-1780\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1780\">maps</a>, items, weapons, and modes. Most maps allow the player to play on foot or in a vehicle (Arwing, Wolfen, or Landmaster), but some only allow the player to be in one. Every member of the Star Fox team (excluding <a href=\"/rob-64/3005-5602\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5602\">R.O.B.</a>) is playable, as is <a href=\"/wolf-odonnell/3005-915\" data-ref-id=\"3005-915\">Wolf O'Donnel</a> of Star Wolf -- team Star Fox's rival pilot group.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/366818-00121138.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366818\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/366818-00121138.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366818\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/366818-00121138.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/366818-00121138.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Flying through space, fighting Oikonny's forces</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Star Fox Assault takes place one year after the events of Star Fox Adventures. <a href=\"/andrew-oikonny/3005-2736\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2736\">Andrew Oikonny</a> ( <a href=\"/andross/3005-1443\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1443\">Andross</a>'s nephew) has taken control of Andross's army, and is now leading an uprising against <a href=\"/corneria/3035-548\" data-ref-id=\"3035-548\">Corneria</a>. Right away, the Star Fox team (now consisting of <a href=\"/fox-mccloud/3005-418\" data-ref-id=\"3005-418\">Fox McCloud</a>, <a href=\"/slippy-toad/3005-419\" data-ref-id=\"3005-419\">Slippy Toad</a>, <a href=\"/falco-lombardi/3005-420\" data-ref-id=\"3005-420\">Falco Lombardi</a>, <a href=\"/krystal/3005-748\" data-ref-id=\"3005-748\">Krystal</a>, and <a href=\"/peppy-hare/3005-1615\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1615\">Peppy Hare</a>) is called in to deal with the threat. They battle their way through Oikonny's forces, but Oikonny escapes to Fortuna. The team follows him, and fights a mock form of Andross's final form (albeit much weaker). However, before the battle is over, Oikonny's ship is destroyed by a large insect-like creature, which proceeds to attack the team. They manage to defeat it and grab its partial \"core memory\" before many more identical creatures attack the group.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The team regroups on the <a href=\"/great-fox/3055-924\" data-ref-id=\"3055-924\">Great Fox</a>, where <a href=\"/beltino-toad/3005-3306\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3306\">Beltino Toad</a> (Slippy's father) reveals to the team that the insect-like creature they fought was an Aparoid, a creature so strong that it could destroy an entire Cornerian fleet with little effort. Before they can do anything else, they pick up a distress signal coming from Katina. Suspecting Aparoid involvement, the team goes to the planet to investigate. Fox inspects the planet on-foot, but is trapped inside of a base along with the Aparoids. With the aid of his team (and a Landmaster dropped in), he fights off the Aparoids, as well as a large disk-like Aparoid with four legs. Before taking the Core Memory, however, <a href=\"/pigma-dengar/3005-1806\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1806\">Pigma Dengar</a> (the original sender of the distress message) sweeps in and steals it, revealing that he hopes to sell it for a high price.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/868399-sargosso.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-868399\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.705\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/868399-sargosso.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-868399\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/868399-sargosso.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/868399-sargosso.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Sargasso Space Zone</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The team tracks down Pigma to the Sargasso Space Zone, a popular hideout for bandits such as Pigma.

After being defeated by the Star Fox team, Panther (in an attempt to flirt with Krystal) reveals that Pigma has gone to Fichina. The team reaches Fichina, where Pigma has deactivated the planet's climate control, turning it into a snowy wasteland. They manage to destroy the Aparoids threatening to destroy the control center, and follow Pigma through an asteroid belt. They catch up to him and find that he has been taken over by Aparoids and has no control over his actions. They fight and defeat him, to gain another Core Memory, this one with information that could lead to the Aparoid Homeworld.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/869301-wingridingsfa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869301\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.78354978354978\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/869301-wingridingsfa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869301\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/869301-wingridingsfa.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/869301-wingridingsfa.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Corneria, after being attacked.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Before the team can go defeat the Aparoid Queen, however, Krystal receives a distress call from the planet Sauria (the setting of Star Fox Adventures). The team goes to the planet and defeats the Aparoids before too much damage can be caused. Krystal and Fox reunite with <a href=\"/prince-tricky/3005-4010\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4010\">Tricky</a>, who is now a teenage EarthWalker. Tricky asks if they are coming back to Sauria for their honeymoon, to which Fox stutters and Krystal laughs. Again, the team is delayed before they can go to the Aparoid Homeworld. This time, <a href=\"/general-pepper/3005-3294\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3294\">General Pepper</a> calls in to the team and informs them that the Aparoids have done a full force attack on Corneria, easily wiping out nearly all of the Cornerian Defense Fleet. With the aid of the Star Wolf team (who have come to help defeat a common enemy), they defeat the Aparoids. However, they learn that General Pepper's ship (along with General Pepper himself) has been taken over by Aparoids. General Pepper insists that Fox destroy him, and Fox complies by shooting down his ship. However, Peppy catches the General on his ship before he hits the ground. After this battle, the team heads to the Orbital Gate, a place where they can warp to the Aparoid Homeworld. Before they can warp there, they are forced to defend it from several Aparoid missiles ranging in sizes. They finish just in time, as Beltino finishes creating a program to destroy all of the Aparoids.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The team manages to make it to the Aparoid Homeworld, but the core of the homeworld is blocked by a base and a large shield. Fox infiltrates the base and destroys a large number of Aparoids. However, according to Slippy, the shields cannot be destroyed by mere laser power. Suddenly, the Great Fox comes into view, piloted by Peppy and <a href=\"/rob-64/3005-5602\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5602\">R.O.B.</a> The Great Fox is covered in Aparoids, and thus severely damaged. All power in the Great Fox is diverted towards its lasers, and it crashes into the shields, opening them wide and long enough for the team to fly through. The Great Fox, however, is destroyed, leading the team to believe that Peppy and R.O.B. are dead.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The team makes it to the core to confront the Aparoid Queen. In an attempt to dissuade the team, she uses the voices of R.O.B., General Pepper, Peppy, Pigma, and <a href=\"/james-mccloud/3005-2021\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2021\">James McCloud</a> (Fox's father). Wolf encourages Fox, however, and he ignores the voices. They blast through the Queen's thick armor, giving Fox enough time to deliver the program. Unfortunately, the Queen suppresses it. Slippy informs Fox that if he does not destroy the Queen, she will create an antibody. The team manages to destroy the Queen, carrying out the self-destruct program in the process. They escape the core, and find that Peppy and R.O.B. survived as well (they used an escape pod before the ship was destroyed). This gives them hope that others who sacrificed to defeat the Aparoids also survived.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Fox McCloud</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/869327-561297_20040511_screen014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869327\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2265625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/869327-561297_20040511_screen014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869327\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/869327-561297_20040511_screen014.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/869327-561297_20040511_screen014.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Fox McCloud</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Fox McCloud is the longtime leader of the mercenary squadron Star Fox.

There, he met Krystal, a female fox with mysterious origins. Since then, the two have developed a bit of a love interest. Fox is the strong leader and skilled pilot of the team; the person everyone looks up to. Of course, the player plays as Fox in the single player campaign, making him one of the most important characters. In this adventure, he must defeat the threat of the Aparoids, and keep them from consuming the <a href=\"/lylat-system/3035-555\" data-ref-id=\"3035-555\">Lylat System</a>.</p><h3>Falco Lombardi</h3><figure style=\"width: 250px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4997/400718-250px_starfox__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-400718\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.704\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:170.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4997/400718-250px_starfox__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-400718\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4997/400718-250px_starfox__1_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4997/400718-250px_starfox__1_.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Falco Lombardi</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Falco Lombardi was mysteriously missing in the last game. His reason for being absent was that he had grown bored with no action in the team. He is back now, this time sporting a bright red jumpsuit. He is the ace pilot of the team, with skills exceeding even those of Fox. As an effect of this, Falco is incredibly cocky and competitive. Despite his constant arguments with Fox (and the rest of the team), he really loves hanging out with his team, and is an indispensable part of the Star Fox team.</p><h3>Krystal</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/727/386293-krystal2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-386293\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/727/386293-krystal2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-386293\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/727/386293-krystal2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/727/386293-krystal2.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Krystal</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Krystal is a mysterious female fox who has only recently joined the Star Fox team. She was first encountered as the \"damsel-in-distress\" of Star Fox Adventures, in which Fox rescued her from the menace of Andross. She has since decided to join the team, and is a decent Arwing pilot herself. Krystal and Fox are a little bit of an item, as they are both interested in each other (which is poked fun at during the game). She is without her trademark staff in this game, instead using the more modern weapons used by the rest of the Star Fox team.</p><h3>Slippy Toad</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7888/255057-slippy3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-255057\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4150943396226\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7888/255057-slippy3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-255057\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7888/255057-slippy3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7888/255057-slippy3.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Slippy Toad</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Slippy Toad returns as the team's trusty mechanic. Slippy repairs all of the vehicles, manages the team's equipment, and provides information on bosses and other important things. Slippy isn't as good of a pilot as Falco or Fox, but he can still hold for himself during an aerial battle (although during the single player campaign, Fox will have to rescue him several times). If he is rescued, however, he drops an item for Fox to use. Many players have found Slippy to be an annoyance, but according to many, he wasn't as annoying in this game, and was rather tolerable.</p><h3>Peppy Hare</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1453/317946-peppy_i_6184.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317946\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.687\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:168.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1453/317946-peppy_i_6184.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-317946\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1453/317946-peppy_i_6184.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1453/317946-peppy_i_6184.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Peppy Hare</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Peppy Hare is the elderly Star Fox team member. He has been in the team since the days of James McCloud, yet he still respects Fox and offers his sage wisdom from time to time. Peppy doesn't actually fly around in an Arwing this game, but rather sits in the Great Fox with R.O.B., and commands the team from there. At one point during the game, he appears to sacrifice himself to the Aparoids, but he and R.O.B. manage to utilize the escape pod on the Great Fox, and fly to freedom.</p><h3>Wolf O'Donnell</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12062/416965-wolf.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-416965\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4141176470588\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12062/416965-wolf.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-416965\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12062/416965-wolf.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12062/416965-wolf.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolf O'Donnell</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Wolf O'Donnell is the leader of the Star Wolf team, and a longtime rival of Fox.

It also has many renovations, and fans have dubbed it the \"Landmaster II.\"</li><li><b>Great Fox</b> - The Great Fox has been completely redone, as last time it was seen, it was crumbling away into ruin. Thankfully, it has been fixed up and is now much sleaker.</li><li><b>Wolfen</b> - The main vehicle of the Star Wolf team. There are some more substantial differences than other models of the ship, leading fans to dub it the Wolfen III.</li></ul><h2>Items and Weapons</h2><figure style=\"width: 305px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/871631-ill15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-871631\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3770491803279\" data-width=\"305\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/871631-ill15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-871631\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/871631-ill15.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/871631-ill15.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>1-UP</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>1-UP</b> - 1-UPs present Fox with an extra life. This allows the player to pick up mid-level, rather than starting over the game.</li><li><b>Barrier Sphere</b> - The Barrier Sphere is a helpful item that, when activated, makes the player temporarily invincible.</li><li><b>Shield Rings (Gold and Silver)</b> - Rings return from previous games to reward the player with ample amounts of health, if they are inside a vehicle. They can also be dropped by allies and enemies, so they are everywhere.</li><li><b>First Aid Kit (Green, Silver, and Gold)</b> - The First Aid Kits are the equivalent of the Shield Rings, except they heal the player when outside of a vehicle. The Green heals a little bit of health, the Silver heals about half, while the rare Gold heals fully.</li><li><b>Special Flag</b> - There are fifty flags in all to find in the single player campaign (five in each of the ten levels). Finding them will unlock various things, including the Devil Launcher in multiplayer.</li><li><b>Smart Bomb</b> - Smart Bombs are a Star Fox tradition. Smart Bombs can be picked up during the level (the player never starts with one), and then fired into a group of enemies, detonating and destroying them. They are much rarer than in previous games.</li><li><b>Laser Power Upgrade (Green and Red)</b> - Another Star Fox standard, the laser upgrades are the same that were in Star Fox Adventures and <a href=\"/star-fox-64/3030-19203\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19203\">Star Fox 64</a>. Picking them up will enhance the lasers, making them much more powerful, and changing their visual appearance.</li><li><b>Stealth Suit (Multiplayer Only)</b> - A multiplayer-only item that (upon being picked up) grants the player invisibility.</li><li><b>Blaster</b> - Fox's default weapon while on foot. Unlike many of the other weapons, it can be charged for a powerful blast. It also never runs out of ammo, making it an all-around versatile gun.</li><li><b>Gattling Gun</b> - The Gattling Gun is basically an automatic version of the Blaster. It lacks the ability to charge, but makes up for it in its ability to quickly clear large rooms of enemies.</li><li><b>Homing Launcher</b> - The Homing Launcher is a useful weapon that can even lock onto enemies. Its reload times aren't exactly stellar, however, so it is best to use it in an area with not many enemies.</li><li><b>Machine Gun</b> - The Machine Gun is essentially a more powerful version of the Gattling Gun. With a high rate of fire and powerful projectiles, it is a good alternative to the Blaster.</li><li><b>Plasma Cannon</b> - The Plasma Cannon can only be used during the single player campaign whenever Fox is riding on someone else's wing. It is incredibly powerful and has infinite ammo, making it quite fun to use when there is the chance.</li><li><b>Sniper Rifle</b> - The Sniper Rifle can only be used when the player is zoomed in and immobile. However, a fired shot is as powerful as a direct hit from the Homing Launcher. It can be quite helpful during a heated multiplayer match.</li><li><b>Grenade</b> - The Grenade is more of the icing on the cake than an actual useful weapon. It can be held onto, allowing the player to decide when it is detonated.

It was released in the United States on December 1, 1988. Originally, the game was only released on the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom Disk System</a> in Japan, and was converted in format to an NES cartridge game for American and European audiences.</p><p>As was the case for the original release of the first Legend of Zelda, Zelda II's original North American release used special gold-colored catridges. Across all territories, the game sold 4.8 million copies. Zelda II has since been rereleased on a variety of platforms in both physical and digital format, including the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds/3045-117\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS</a>, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a>.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Franchise Influence</h2><p>Though many specifics of the game's format have not been used in the franchise since, it has had a strong influence on the franchise with elements it introduced. It was the first game in the series to feature towns houses that can be explored, and NPCs also have a much more expanded role and play a pivotal role in Link's journey. Zelda II is also the first game in the series to feature a proper magic system with a separate gauge used to measure Link's magical reserves.</p><p>Perhaps the most unique element of Zelda II is its side-scrolling action perspective. Sides-scrolling gameplay has not played a major role in the franchise since its use in this title, save for two of the three <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cd-i/3045-27\" data-ref-id=\"3045-27\">Philips CD-i</a> Zelda titles produced without Nintendo's involvement. However, sidescrolling elements would later be reused in a minor way in some of the handheld Zelda adventures.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overworld</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511932\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511932\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\"/></a><figcaption>The overworld.</figcaption></figure><p>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link eschews the gameplay format of the original <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">Legend of Zelda</a>, and no entry in the series has played like it since. While it keeps a top-down perspective for the overworld, combat does not directly take place from this viewpoint. Like many RPGs, the overworld perspective is used for travel throughout Hyrule, from town to town and dungeon to dungeon.</p><p>The overworld is broken down into segments which initially cannot be traversed until Link is able to acquire the appropriate item. For example, some routes are blocked by impassable boulders that cannot be circumvented in the early portions of the game. However, after Link acquires the hammer, he is gains the ability to smash boulders, clearing these paths. In this way, the game keeps a sense of linearity where most dungeons need to be completed in a certain order so that the appropriate item can be obtained.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Sidescrolling and Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511968\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511968\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Link takes on a dungeon boss.</figcaption></figure><p>When in the overworld, the player will find towns and caves to enter and explore, as well as roving icons representing monster encounters.

When Link dies, either by running out of health or falling into a pit, he will restart at the entrance to the current screen. However, when Link has lost all of his lives, the game is over and the player has to restart from the North Castle; the starting point of the game. Extra lives in the form of small Link dolls can be found in secret locations around the world.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Magic Spells</h3><p>The Adventure of Link was the first game in the series to feature a magic system. It is also the first game that provides Link with a list of spells, as well as a magic gauge that governs their usage. Similar to other role-playing games, any time Link uses a magic spell, it drains energy from the magic gauge. Link learns new spells as he travels, acquiring them from the wise men in each of the towns he visits on his quest. These spells don't come easy, however, as Link often has to complete side quests that involve such tasks as retrieving items and killing monsters before the wise men will teach him their spells. Many of the spells in the game are integral to the game's progress, such as the Jump spell that temporarily boosts Link's maximum jump height, or the Fairy spell that transforms Link into a small, flying fairy capable of crossing long gaps and chasms.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Set after the original Legend of Zelda, The Adventure of Link revolves around Link's quest to remove a curse placed upon <a href=\"/zelda/3005-5\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Princess Zelda</a>. When her father the king passed away, the <a href=\"/triforce/3055-18\" data-ref-id=\"3055-18\">Triforce</a> was supposed to go to Zelda\u2019s brother, the prince. However, the king, unsure of his son's true nature, had instead told Zelda the location of the final piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Courage. The prince, eventually learning of this from a wizard, goes to Zelda, demanding to know the location of the Triforce of Courage, but Zelda refuses to tell him. The wizard casts a spell on the princess, causing her to sleep forever unless the full Triforce is recovered, but passes away before the prince can convince him to undo the spell. Realizing his error, the grief-stricken prince keeps Princess Zelda in the North Castle, where she is to sleep until her curse can be lifted. He also decreed that henceforth all princesses in Hyrule would be named Zelda.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-528810\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-528810\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Link must face his own shadow at the end of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Following Link's triumph over Ganon in the original game, Ganon\u2019s minions are in a state of unrest, as his spirit still remains, but needs Link\u2019s blood in order to come back to life. After Link learns of the curse placed upon Princess Zelda, he sets out to recover the Triforce of Courage. By doing so, he can destroy Ganon once and for all, bring peace back to Hyrule, and rouse Princess Zelda from her eternal sleep.</p><p>Link's quest takes him across Hyrule and into six different palaces, acquiring items and spells to help him along the way. Upon entering the final dungeon, Link is forced to once again fight the spirit of Ganon. However, even with Ganon defeated and the Triforce of Courage in sight, Link has one more trial he must overcome. He must fight his own <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dark-link/3005-5534\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5534\">shadow</a>.

Enemy dropships also patrol the paths; when the helicopter encounters them, Rad is dropped into a short, linear stage where he must defeat parachuting enemies and get to the end of the zone.<br /><br />Over the game, Rad gains specialized pieces of equipment that can offer additional strategic options when in battle. He also gets access to a growing selection of guns to choose from before being airdropped. As each gun can have its advantages, selecting the right tool for the job is the key to victory.<br /><br />The game does not use a save system, instead relying on a password mechanic to let the player pick up where he left off over multiple play sessions. Passwords consist of various geometric shapes arranged on a grid.<br /><br /><h2>Game Boy Vs N.E.S. Differences</h2><br />Despite sporting drastically different visual styles, both the Game Boy and the Nintendo versions of Bionic Commando have strong similarities. Being a reboot of sorts, Bionic Commando on the Game Boy takes the original story and tweaks it while still paying respect to the original Japanese version.<br /><br /><h3>Story</h3>Instead of going up against the Nazis lead by Adolf Hitler, or the Badds led by Generalissimo Killt, Rad instead takes the fight to the Doraize Dukedom and its leader, Director Wiseman (the original name of Killt's character from the Japanese version of the NES Bionic Commando). Additionally, while the NES version had the Badds plot to revive Master D, the Game Boy's Director Wiseman instead only sought to activate the Albatross, a mighty flying fortress.\u00a0 In the end, both games require the same precise finishing blow to achieve victory, except that the Game Boy's final explosion lacks a certain bit of color (in the form of an animated sequence of Hitler's head exploding).<br /><br /><h3>Visual Theme</h3>While the original NES title had a contemporary military theme overall, the Game Boy incarnation punches up the technology level into sci-fi territory. Characters leave the modern army templates aside to go for spiky hair, arm-mounted cannons, futuristic armour and the iconic grapple.<br /><br />Of note are the cinematics of the opening sequence, which are a step up from the NES ones. They go so far as to trick depth of field effects out of the limited Game Boy hardware to make backgrounds seem blurry and far away.<br /><br /><h3>Gameplay</h3>Travel over the overland map is still the same in both versions, except that enemy transports were changed from trucks to high-tech dropship aircraft. While in the original, the troop transport encounters were top-down, here they keep the same platform mechanics found in the rest of the game and enemies parachute down instead. The game as a whole is also more forgiving than the NES Bionic Commando, starting the player off with a three-hit lifebar (as opposed to the NES's one-hit-wonder commando) and using a mild RPG element for lengthening it as enemy tokens are obtained.", "deck": "The Game Boy version of Bionic Commando is technically the third in the series but is not a direct sequel.

Levels have horizontal and vertical progression, designed with multiple platforms, ledges and even fences on which to grab. Levels are generally capped off with a boss battle. Though not a one-hit-kill game, the player character can take damage merely by touching enemies. The protagonist can also jump and crouch. His jump is a fair mix between tight and floaty, allowing for lenient mid-air control resembling that of a <a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man</a> game. He can also punch while crouching and in the air, but can only punch left or right--he cannot throw uppercuts to take down enemies above his head.</p><p>While the primary means of self-defense is this simple punch, the player character can punch crates to collect power-ups in order to summon a floating drone which attacks with a different set of projectiles every time he punches. Drones are summoned once the player collects three drone power-ups, which are denoted as either Alpha or Beta. With the three slots and the two power-ups, there are six different possible combinations. Furthermore, punching a power-up changes it to its counterpart (punch an Alpha power-up and it will change into a Beta), so the player hascontrol over which drone they want to summon. If they happen to collect three alpha/beta power-ups while they already have a drone summoned, they will then don a metallic suit that increases strength and gives the player character a special attack corresponding to the combination of power-ups they've obtained.</p><p>The player can also collect currency from crates, which can be used on power-up platforms that increase the strength of their punches; give an extra life; or replenish their health. Some crates will yield a moneybag which can be collected, but it's more beneficial to actually <i>punch </i>the bag repeatedly to generate extra money--similar to how one might collect multiple coins repeatedly from the same block in <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3025-1899\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1899\">Super Mario Bros.</a> games.

The main form of attack is a spinning shield on a chain called the \"diskarmor,\" which is tossed out like a yo-yo.

In console versions, clues and limited dialogue are given in the form of large, sage-like men encountered in stone green temples throughout the game. In the Japanese original, references to \"Ligar\" and \"Rygar\" are one and the same, due to the fact that the Roman syllables \"Li\" and \"Ry\" come from the same Japanese character. As such, the hero is only referred to as \"The Legendary Warrior\", while both \"Rygar\" and \"Ligar\" refer to the main villain.</p><p>The Japanese version of this game contains different music than its English localizations.</p><p>Despite existing as a counterpart to an existing arcade game, this NES version of Rygar was released back into arcades on Nintendo's PlayChoice-10 hardware in 1987.</p>", "deck": "Rygar is a classic game for many home consoles.

href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Famicom/NES</a> game by<a href=\"/sunsoft/3010-19\" data-ref-id=\"3010-19\"> Sunsoft</a> that was only released in Japan and Scandinavia. The game was supposedly scheduled for release worldwide, but was never released outside the aforementioned territories.</p><p>Since it was released so late in the FC/NES lifespan, the game sold poorly. The Japanese release is a bit more common, but the Scandinavian release is now considered to be one of the rarest and most expensive SCN region games released, and is sought after by collectors. It has a cult following these days due to its great gameplay and technically impressive graphics and soundtrack.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The intro opens with a girl blowing out candles on her birthday. She receives a present which turns out to be Mr. Gimmick, a plush toy doll. She loves him more than any of her other toys. Because of this, the other toys get jealous and kidnap the girl while she sleeps, taking her into the dimension of toys. Now it's up to Mr. Gimmick to save her.</p><p>Mr. Gimmick features two endings. In order to get the good ending, the player must collect a secret item in each of the first six stages of the game without using any continues. Only by doing this is the path to the true final stage and boss unlocked.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/817047-1170738620_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817047\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.876\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/817047-1170738620_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817047\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/817047-1170738620_00.png\"/></a><figcaption>The world map.</figcaption></figure><p>Mr. Gimmick is a side-scrolling platformer. Mr. Gimmick's only weapon and tool is a star he can create and throw. The star is used to defeat enemies, and can be used to solve simple environmental puzzles.</p><p>The star features a simple physics system that affects how it bounces depending on from where it's dropped; the higher it's dropped from, the higher it will bounce. And so if Mr. Gimmick jumps before throwing it, or throws it from a platform, it will bounce higher. Mr. Gimmick can also stand on top of the star as it bounces if he jumps on top of it. Jumping on a thrown star is required to progress in some areas of the game.</p><p>In the game's first six levels, Mr. Gimmick must find a hidden item somewhere in the stage, and then defeat the boss at he end. As stated above, to get the good ending and rescue the girl, Mr. Gimmick must collect the hidden item in every level to make the final, secret level appear, and defeat the final boss. If any of the hidden items are missed, or any continues are used, the game will end after the boss on level 6, resulting in a bad ending where the girl is not rescued.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The Japanese version of the game starts Mr. Gimmick out with three lives, while the Scandinavian version starts him out with seven lives.</li></ul><ul><li>The Japanese release had a special version of the AY-3-8910 sound chip, also used in the Amstrad CPC and Atari ST computers, embedded in the MMC chip to help the regular Famicom sound chip with the music. This sound chip was not embedded in the MMC in the Scandinavian release because the NES does not have pins on the connector for external sound chips, instead having four pins for the lockout chip. Because of this, the Scandinavian version's soundtrack is reworked to only use the internal NES sound chip. As a result, some instruments are missing in some songs, or sometimes sound different than in the Japanese version.</li></ul><ul><li>The Scandinavian release, like most of Sunsoft's PAL releases, is optimized for 50hz. Because of this, the soundtrack does not sound correctly when played on an NTSC NES console. Not just that it runs faster, but the digitized drums and DPCM sounds are especially affected. Since the graphics have also been tweaked for the PAL NES, there are also major graphics glitches when playing on an NTSC NES.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1630637\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1630637\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The PCB of the Scandinavian release, showing the custom mapper chip (the square-shaped chip).</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The game uses a custom mapper chip, the Sunsoft <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_Management_Controller#FME-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">FME-7</a>, which enhances the graphics capabilities of the console. This was included in both the Japanese and Scandinavian release, though the Japanese version includes the AY-3-8910 sound chip embedded as mentioned previously. Having a custom MMC chip was pretty common for Famicom games, but on the NES it was very unusual. Most other third party games that used a custom mapper chip, like <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a>'s <a href=\"/contra/3030-4350\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4350\">Contra</a>, were reworked for Nintendo's MMC chips when released for NES. This chip, together with the sound chip in the Japanese release, probably added up to make this an expensive game to manufacture.</li></ul>", "releases": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-89880/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mr-gimmick/3030-6037/releases/", "id": 89880, "name": "Gimmick!"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-89881/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mr-gimmick/3030-6037/releases/", "id": 89881, "name": "Mr. Gimmick"}], "franchises": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-6037/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "objects": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/object/3055-1818/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/star/3055-1818/", "id": 1818, "name": "Star"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/object/3055-365/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/beam-sword/3055-365/", "id": 365, "name": "Beam Sword"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/object/3055-97/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bomb/3055-97/", "id": 97, "name": "Bomb"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/object/3055-183/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/spikes/3055-183/", "id": 183, "name": "Spikes"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/object/3055-1438/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/vial/3055-1438/", "id": 1438, "name": "Vial"}], "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:56:05", "first_appearance_concepts": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-27/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/multiple-endings/3015-27/", "id": 27, "name": "Multiple Endings"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-3349/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/enemies-emerging-from-eggs/3015-3349/", "id": 3349, "name": "Enemies Emerging From Eggs"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-50/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/boss-fight/3015-50/", "id": 50, "name": "Boss Fight"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-22/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/cutscene/3015-22/", "id": 22, "name": "Cutscene"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-634/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sound-test/3015-634/", "id": 634, "name": "Sound Test"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-7753/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pixel-art/3015-7753/", "id": 7753, "name": "Pixel Art"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-100/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/damsel-in-distress/3015-100/", "id": 100, "name": "Damsel In Distress"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-3130/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/living-toys/3015-3130/", "id": 3130, "name": "Living Toys"}], "name": "Mr. Gimmick", "killed_characters": null, "first_appearance_locations": null, "concepts": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-27/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/multiple-endings/3015-27/", "id": 27, "name": "Multiple Endings"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-3349/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/enemies-emerging-from-eggs/3015-3349/", "id": 3349, "name": "Enemies Emerging From Eggs"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-50/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/boss-fight/3015-50/", "id": 50, "name": "Boss Fight"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-22/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/cutscene/3015-22/", "id": 22, "name": "Cutscene"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-634/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sound-test/3015-634/", "id": 634, "name": "Sound Test"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-7753/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pixel-art/3015-7753/", "id": 7753, "name": "Pixel Art"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-100/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/damsel-in-distress/3015-100/", "id": 100, "name": "Damsel In Distress"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-3130/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/living-toys/3015-3130/", "id": 3130, "name": "Living Toys"}]}, "platform": "NES", "title": "Gimmick!"}

In many ways, it can be considered a spiritual successor to <a href=\"/sega/3010-62\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a>'s Tetris, which appeared in Japanese arcades in 1988. TGM inherits many defining traits from Sega's game and builds upon that core with new mechanics refinements and challenges.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Rotation</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">TGM adopts Sega's simple yet effective rotation tables. With the exception of the red I-piece, every pieces are always kept level when rotated (i.e. aligned with the bottom of the bounding box); this helps ensure a piece can rotate cleanly on the surface of the stack, which is crucial when the game reaches the highest fall speeds.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One addition to the rotation system comes in the form of wallkicks: if the piece collides with something when rotating, the game tries to nudge the piece one cell to the right or one cell to the left (in that order) before failing to rotate. There are a few exceptions where wallkicks will not be applied:</p><ol><li>for I or O pieces.</li><li>for L/J/T pieces, if the center column of the piece will be blocked after rotation.</li><li>when using Initial Rotation (see below).</li></ol><h3>Game flow</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like Sega Tetris, TGM features a brief <em>entry delay</em> before each piece appears that can be used to prepare the next move. By holding left or right during this period, the player can \"warm up\" or <em>charge</em> movement so the next piece will enter the playfield moving full speed. The player may also \"pre-rotate\" (or <em>Initial Rotate</em>) the piece once by holding the desired rotation button until the piece appears.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">TGM maintains the quick piece movement speed afforded in Sega Tetris. After holding left/right for a brief, quarter-second delay, the piece continues moving at a rate of one unit per frame (or, <em>1 </em><i>G)</i>. Holding down to drop a piece also moves at the rate of 1G.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another crucial feature inherited from Sega is <em>lock delay</em>. Whereas most other early Tetris games would lock pieces into place as soon as they touched the ground, Sega allowed a half-second delay before the piece locked. This allowed Sega Tetris to offer challenging yet playable 1G fall speeds, where other games shied away or relegated it to use as a kill-screen. TGM continues in these footsteps and pushes beyond into new frontiers -- 2G, 3G, 5G, and even 20G (i.e., max gravity or instant drop) fall speeds are achieved.</p><h3>Levels</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Unlike many other <em>Tetris</em> games, progress is not solely tied to the number of lines cleared. Instead, the level counter increases by one for every piece placed or line cleared. As a result, game speed can gradually change as the player continues to place pieces, even if they are not necessarily clearing lines. (In another nod to Sega Tetris, at one or two level checkpoints the speed will actually drop to give the player a short breather rather than relentlessly continue to speed up.)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At the end of each <em>section</em> of 100 lines, the player must clear a line to progress to the next. (i.e., if the player reaches the <em>level stop</em> at 99, the counter will not continue to increase until a line is cleared.)</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At level 500, the fall speed plateaus at 20G. The player must continue to endure the restrictions of max gravity play and reach level 999 to complete the game.</p><h3>Time Attack</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another divergence from typical Tetris norms is a shift in focus to speed rather than just score. While earning points does play a key role in achieving some of the game's main goals, it does not directly impact one's position on a machine's leaderboard - instead, a player's ranking is determined by a combination of grade (see more on Grades below) and how quickly they achieved it. Once players have filled the game's ranking with Grand Master performances, earning a high score becomes a matter of racing to complete the game the quickest</p><h3>Scoring</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Points are scored whenever lines are cleared. A few factors determine the value of the line clear:</p><ul><li>number of lines cleared - as usual, scoring four line clears (or tetrises) is the most lucrative, triple and double line clears are moderately valued, and single line clears earn a pittance.</li><li>current level - point values gradually and linearly increase throughout the game.</li><li>number of rows the piece was forced by holding down.</li><li>combo bonus for continuing to clear lines with consecutive pieces.</li><li><em>Bravo</em> bonus - 4x multiplier for performing a \"perfect clear\" removing all blocks from the playfield.</li></ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, as earning points alone is not the core focus of the game, so it's not strictly necessary to employ more complex scoring methods; playing quickly and making tetrises will earn a sufficient number of points to achieve endgame goals.</p><h3>Grades</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another new feature is the Grade Recognition System. The player is awarded grades for passing certain score milestones or meeting other criteria. The player starts at grade 9 when the game begins and works their way up. The scale ranges from 9 to 1, S1 to S9, and finally the title of Grand Master (or GM). The player must meet various conditions throughout the game:</p><ul><li>achieve grade 1 and level 300 within 4 minutes 15 seconds.</li><li>achieve grade S4 and level 500 within 7 minutes 30 seconds.</li><li>earn at least 126,000 points and finish the game within 13 minutes 30 seconds.</li></ul>", "releases": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-139285/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tetris-the-grand-master/3030-42507/releases/", "id": 139285, "name": "Tetris: The Grand Master"}], "franchises": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/franchise/3025-1378/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tetris-the-grand-master/3025-1378/", "id": 1378, "name": "Tetris: The Grand Master"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/franchise/3025-291/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tetris/3025-291/", "id": 291, "name": "Tetris"}], "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-42507/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "objects": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/object/3055-1142/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/meteor/3055-1142/", "id": 1142, "name": "Meteor"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/object/3055-1722/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tetromino/3055-1722/", "id": 1722, "name": "Tetromino"}], "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2013-04-28 02:58:38", "first_appearance_concepts": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-2678/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/vision-obstruction/3015-2678/", "id": 2678, "name": "Vision Obstruction"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-183/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/difficulty-level/3015-183/", "id": 183, "name": "Difficulty Level"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-1061/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/countdown-timer/3015-1061/", "id": 1061, "name": "Countdown Timer"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-180/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/heads-up-display/3015-180/", "id": 180, "name": "Heads Up Display"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-1427/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/2d/3015-1427/", "id": 1427, "name": "2D"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-712/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fireworks/3015-712/", "id": 712, "name": "Fireworks"}], "name": "Tetris: The Grand Master", "killed_characters": null, "first_appearance_locations": null, "concepts": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-2678/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/vision-obstruction/3015-2678/", "id": 2678, "name": "Vision Obstruction"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-183/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/difficulty-level/3015-183/", "id": 183, "name": "Difficulty Level"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-1061/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/countdown-timer/3015-1061/", "id": 1061, "name": "Countdown Timer"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-180/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/heads-up-display/3015-180/", "id": 180, "name": "Heads Up Display"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-1427/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/2d/3015-1427/", "id": 1427, "name": "2D"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/concept/3015-712/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fireworks/3015-712/", "id": 712, "name": "Fireworks"}]}, "platform": "Arcade", "title": "Tetris: The Grand Master Series Exhibition"}

It was followed by two spin-offs; <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8456\" href=\"/an-elder-scrolls-legend-battlespire/3030-8456\">An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-642\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-adventures-redguard/3030-642\">The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</a>, and eventually a sequel in May 2002, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17367\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/3030-17367\">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238\">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> followed in 2006. The most recent game in the series, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33394\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394\">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>, was released in November 2011. It received many awards including several Game of the Year awards.</p><h3>The World</h3><p>Daggerfall features the largest game world to date, containing 161,600 square kilometers (40,400,000 acres) of explorabale land and over 15,000 towns, cities and villages. According to <a data-ref-id=\"3040-57173\" href=\"/todd-howard/3040-57173\">Todd Howard</a>, Morrowind's land area is 0.01% the size of Daggerfall. This was down to an algorithm that generated terrain, which led to possibly the largest game world created. The design of the following Elder Scrolls games has been to move away from this technique and emphasis in size and instead to concentrate on detail.</p><p>The size of the world is so large that it merited a place in the Games edition of the Guiness Book of World Records, <a href=\"http://bethblog.com/index.php/2008/02/29/guinness-reveals-elder-scrolls-records/\" rel=\"nofollow\">stating</a> that the world has an estimated 63,125 square miles of land.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>To alleviate long wait times to travel from destination to destination in the large game world the game employs various forms of fast-travel in the game. Ships allow for free transport by sea, and ship can be accessed at any time in the inventory menu, transporting you into the middle of the huge ocean aboard your craft. The player may also use horses, which are also accessible from the inventory menu.</p><p>Unlike in the later games, gold in Daggerfall has weight, which necessitates that players use the banking system in order to prevent their holdings from weighing them down. The bank charges 1% to take in this money, and issues letters of credit, which have neglible weight. Banks also allow the player the chance to buy property in the towns in which that particular bank is located as well as buy ships or take out loans.</p><p>Also unlike its sequel Morrowind, Daggerfall had a wall-climbing system whereby if the player was skilled enough they could scale flat mountainous surfaces. This lead to great ways to circumvent obstacles, but also could get you stuck way too high to jump down, and it would sometimes lead to you being stuck outside of the games' geometry. An area fans of the game have called colloquially \"The Void.\"</p><p>When dungeon crawling, the player is treated to large dungeons like the game world. Dungeons tend to have a certain type of enemy spawned in them, for example one place might be a den of vampires, while another will have large natural critters. As these dungeons are procedurally generated it can extended periods of time to fully explore them. Because of their procedural nature dungeons can sometimes employ a strange combination dungeon elements as they are randomly combined from various designer parts. Dungeons can have entire underwater areas, and usually have special passageways as well as secret panels that lead the player to something interesting. For some of these dungeons there is a three-dimensional dungeon automap built-in to assist the players.</p><p>There are several dungeons which were hand-made to provide specific traps, treasures, and encounters in service of the game's plot. Also there are several endings based on how the player attacks the problems facing the empire.</p><h3>Bugs</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2010/305168-1048384669_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305168\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2010/305168-1048384669_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305168\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2010/305168-1048384669_00.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Adventuring on horseback.</figcaption></figure><p>Daggerfall was infamous for its proliferation of major bugs and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-511\" href=\"/glitch/3015-511\">glitches</a>, usually attributed to a rush to bring the game to shelves. Incredibly, there was a bug evident in the release version of the game which prevented the player from finishing the main questline. The majority of these bugs have been fixed with the final patch as well as sequential patches. However the ability to randomly fall through the floor and the occasional risk of having a save becoming corrupted still exists. There are also other bugs and exploits which still exist despite the final patch being issued, although some in the homebrew community have managed to address certain issues with later, non-official fixes.</p><p>Generally speaking, the most ruinous of bugs was the dreaded Void. Diagonal surfaces, stairs, and certain other terrain forms had clipping problems which would cause a character to fall through solid surfaces, plummeting them to their death far below in the box-like playing field that a dungeon or building resided. Players could survive this in various ways, but it was often impossible to return to a dungeon without teleportation or levitation spells.</p><p>Since the re-release of the free version no new bugs have been fixed, with the last official patch being frozen at \"213.\" Players are thus encouraged to save often, and in different save slots. Players can export their save folders to accomodate for new ones should they decide they want to use more than the six provided.</p><p>While not a bug, there are certain ways to <i><b>ruin your chances to finish the main quest of the game</b></i>, so it's advisable not to talk to anyone in the three main castles so as not to accidentally refuse a quest which would be necessary for the game's completion.</p><h3>Availability</h3><p>Daggerfall can be found on the Bethesda website as of 2009, as well as some abandonware sites. It requires DOSbox to run properly on non-DOS machines, though Bethesda has included a handy install guide for those who use Windows XP and DOSBox, downloadable from the same page as their release of Daggerfall.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Privateer's Hold</h3><p>Priaveteer's Hold is the beginning dungeon, and is the same every time one begins a game. It is considered to be a brutal starting location, especially for non-combat classes, but meta-gaming it will allow players some experimentation for character balance that will result in a much more viable character should you emerge unscathed.</p><h3>The Procedurally Generated Side-Dungeons</h3><p>All other non-main dungeons are procedurally generated using elements familiar to those who know Privateer's Hold, plus many others. These dungeons are not generated in-game, but instead stored within the software, having been pre-generated procedurally when the game was first created. These labyrinths have basic laws which help players navigate them, but part of the gameplay is that one never quite knows what one will experience when one enters one of these made tangles of corridors.</p><p>Each of these dungeons have several points of interest where a quest object, such as an item, monster or person, will be spawned. These are marked in such a way that a cheat code can allow the player to transport to each of them in order to find quest objects easily. Corridors follow their own rules based upon their corridor type, so the player will have to navigate a certain style of corridor for a certain length, which may last for thousands of game steps. The procedural generation will allow for a corridor to link to another corridor or room type which lead to many cases of user confusion.</p><p>As with the points of interest mentioned above, rooms and some corridors have points where traps, usable objects, loot, and monsters may be spawned. While the contents of these spaces may change, the types won't. The player will find monsters in monster spaces, and loot in loot spaces, even if the loot will be randomly generated when you pick it up. Traps are especially devious, as they may be invisible areas that cause damage, or objects that when touched damage the player character, possibly at lethal levels. The player can also encounter random sprites that activate teleportation effects, and others (i.e. levers) can be used to open locked doors and passageways.</p><p>Teleportation effects are achieved through touching special objects, entering certain zones, or entering some red-brick doorways. These teleports are always circular, meaning enough exploration will lead the player character back to where he or she started, either through the maze or through further use of teleportation objects. This might give the player access to otherwise inaccessible loot, or even points of interest.</p><p>Finally, there are secret doors, which are sometimes obvious and sometimes cleverly hidden within the texture of a given wall. The best way to find these is by checking the automap, where one can easily see doorways within rooms and hallways. Crypts are notably minor variations of this, and have a very small amount of corridors, secrets, and loot. Crypts in certain regions often fall prey to a bug where an actual door will spawn at the entrance to a dungeon, which may cause the character to spawn outside of the dungeon upon entry, and it can create large, inaccessible areas of the crypt that are whole crypt regions in and of themselves.</p><h3>Overworld Locations</h3><p>Towns of four sizes, homes, crypt entry locations, dungeon entry locations, witches' covens, temples, and hermitages dot Daggerfall's immense landmass. All but the capital of Daggerfall itself are subject to a fairly standard encounters when not on a quest: when you rest a monster or humanoid may be randomly generated, and when manually traversing one can occasionally run into local wildlife. One cannot have random encounters when fast-traveling.</p><p>Any location with more than one building is procedurally generated, although this is usually less dramatic than the dungeons. Players will find certain building placement behaviors, like market squares, but for the most part the buildings are fairly separate and don't face in a certain direction except perhaps in the capital cities. Occasionally there will be errors in generation, such as buildings which are on the map but do not exist, buildings which will not label themselves or don't act as commercial buildings when labeled as such, and other anomalies.</p><p>Different regions also generate different sprites, so the more tropical home of the Redguard will have wilder plantlife, and in the north it is more likely to have snowy areas. The land itself is largely flat, with some bumpy 3D surfaces that can occasionally get a bit more rocky in mountainous areas. While navigating Daggerfall on foot the player may stumble upon an undiscovered site or loot.</p><p>In addition all of these, there is a corner of the map where a ship spawns if one purchases it. This ship is teleported to and exists in the middle of the ocean. Without teleporting it would take hours, perhaps days, real-time to swim back to shore from the ship. Within the ship, like houses that one purchases from the bank, one can place one's possessions in the ship, although they must be placed on the ground, not in containers, lest they disappear.</p><h3>The Void</h3><p>Outside of all buildings, when one is inside them, is a place commonly called The Void. It is a black non-play area that all buildings exist in. Buildings float in the void, and each building exists in its own void (meaning buildings that are next to each other in a city are not next to each other in the void). The void would be immaterial to the game except that during certain clipping or spawning errors, players can wind up outside of a given building. The void is lethal, in that you can fall to your death in it (one is often inexplicably paralyzed just before hitting this lethal bottom area), and it is very hard to enter back into a building once exiled, unless one cheats or teleports. Levitation allows the player to move the character about, and the player will be able to see inside building segments, and stand on top of them. Entry is possible occasionally by manipulating the same clipping weaknesses that likely got the player character into the void in the first place.</p><p>Creatures, too, can wind up in the void, causing a frustrating problem if your quest is to destroy these creatures. Creatures in the void are nigh impossible to kill without cheating or being stuck in the void too. On top of this creatures in The Void prevent a character from sleeping or being able to rest due to their proximity to the player.</p>", "deck": "The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall from Bethesda Softworks is an enormous RPG and sequel to The Elder Scrolls: Arena.

The player is released from a prison boat into a small fishing village called <a href=\"/seyda-neen/3035-2742\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2742\">Seyda Neen</a>.</p><blockquote><p><i>In the waning years of the</i></p><p><i>Third Era of Tamriel,</i></p><p><i>a prisoner born on a certain day</i></p><p><i>to uncertain parents was sent</i></p><p><i>under guard, without explanation, to Morrowind,</i></p><p><i>ignorant of the role he was</i></p><p><i>to play in that nation's history\u2026</i></p></blockquote><p>In the Census office the released prisoner is given a package by an Imperial Officer to be delivered to a man named <a href=\"/caius-cosades/3005-3588\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3588\">Caius Cosades</a> who is currently residing in the town of <a href=\"/balmora/3035-1351\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1351\">Balmora</a>. Thus begins the game, and story in earnest. The player at this point is given the freedom to visit any location and complete any side quest without harming or disrupting the main questline. If the prisoner so wishes, they continue onward to a new life and Balmora; the main hub of the Hlaalu faction and major economic center that effectively links the civilized western world with the technologically backwards and savage east.</p><p>Upon arriving at Cosades abode, the player is admitted as a novice into the Empire serving faction \"Blades\". The Blades is indicated to be an organization with the duty of spying for the Empire; \"We're spies. We're the Emperor's hidden eyes and ears in the provinces.\" Cosades gives the prisoner their second task: visit his friend Hasphat Antabolis at the Balmora Fighters Guild and get schooled on the local lore and learn of various cults gaining strength in Vvardenfell. Unfortunately, Hasphat Antabolis won't simply share his knowledge for nothing and thus gives the prisoner their third task: visit a nearby Dwemer ruin and find a specific artifact.</p><p>Upon the retrieval and delivery of the artifact, Antabolis gives the player notes to be delivered to Cosades and read by the prisoner. The note describes the various cults in Vvardenfell: the Sixth House, <i>\"House Dagoth is an extinct Great House. In the wake of the ancient Battle of Red Mountain, its leadership was revealed to have plotted treason, and was discredited\"</i>, and information on relevant historical events, the War of the First Council: \"<i>...a First Age religious conflict between the secular Dunmer Houses Dwemer and Dagoth and the orthodox Dunmer Houses Indoril, Redoran, Dres, Hlaalu, and Telvanni.</i>\". And the Nerevarine cult: \"When the Dunmer followed Veloth to Morrowind, they were many warring clans ... One Dunmer warlord, Nerevar, had the ambition to rule all the Dunmer.\"</p><p>The player is tasked, from Cosades, to seek further information on the Nerevarine by searching for ancient texts and informants scattered around Vvardenfell. Why all this is important to the player remains a mystery, until Cosades reveals that the Imperial Legion believes the player character could very well be the Nerevarine reborn. The benefits the Empire could reap from such an event would be immense; having an ancient Dunmer man-god ally would gain the Imperial Legion an even stronger foothold in Morrowind, and the continued attempts of thwarting Dagoth Ur and his fanatical cults would win some support amongst the native Dunmer.</p><p>Cosades is recalled to the <a href=\"/the-imperial-city/3035-1659\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1659\">Imperial City</a>; <i>\"Internal politics. Some concern about my sugar ... As the Emperor's health declines, factions are maneuvering for advantage. I may be gone a while ...\"</i>. The player is now the top ranking Blades agent in Vvardenfell. The player continues on his or her journey to discover whether they truly are the Nerevarine; and is soon on the search for ancient prophecies, 'the Lost Prophecies'.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"From seventh sign of eleventh generation,</i></p><p><i>Neither Hound nor Guar, nor Seed nor Harrow,</i></p><p><i>But Dragon-born and far-star-marked,</i></p><p><i>Outlander Incarnate beneath Red Mountain,</i></p><p><i>Blessed Guest counters seven curses,</i></p><p><i>Star-blessed hand wields thrice-cursed blade,</i></p><p><i>To reap the harvest of the unmourned house.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>The search leads the player to a monastery where they are informed they must go through a series of tests to determine if they truly are the Nerevarine. The first prophesy being that the Nerevarine, incarnate of Nerevar, is born from uncertain parents on a certain day. The second prophesy dictates that the Nerevarine must contract and overcome the Corprus disease. The fourth, the player character must find <a href=\"/indoril-nerevar/3005-16939\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16939\">Indoril Nerevar's</a> ring Moon-and-Star. Upon finding the Moon-and-Star, the player has a vision and <a href=\"/azura/3005-3578\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3578\">Azura</a>, a Daedric Queen, confirms that the player is indeed the Nerevarine.</p><p>The fifth and sixth prophesies see the Nerevarine rally the people of Vvardenfell under a single banner. In order to do so, the player must be acknowledged as a war leader, the so called Hortator, by all three Great Houses of Morrowind (Hlaalu, Redoran, and Telvanni), and as Nerevarine, the true incarnate of Nerevar, by four native Dunmer tribes (Ahemmusa, Zainab, Urshilaku, and Erabenimsun). Shortly after that, <a href=\"/vivec/3005-1384\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1384\">Vivec</a>, the warrior-poet man-God of Morrowind, invites the Nerevarine to his palace to discuss <a href=\"/dagoth-ur/3005-7163\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7163\">Dagoth Ur</a>, his followers, and the Heart of Lorkhan. The Heart is immune to normal weapons and requires the ancients Dwemer artifacts. 'Wraithguard' to protect the user, and 'Sunder' and 'Keening' to cause damage to the Heart itself.</p><p>After finding 'Sunder' and 'Keening', the Nerevarine then travels to Red Mountain to Dagoth Urs stronghold. The player finds Dagoth Ur deep within Red Mountain. Dagoth Ur attempts trick the Nerevarine into joining him and asks the Nerevarine his last questions: <i>\"My first question is: Are you really Nerevar reborn?\"</i> the Nerevarine responds: <i>\"By the grace of gods and fate, I am Nerevar reborn.\"</i>. After a short discourse, Dagoth Ur and the Nerevar incarnate, long ago brothers fighting together for the same cause, now commence fighting each other.</p><p>After overpowering Dagoth Ur, he retreats to the hall where the Heart of Lorkhan resides. Before the Nerevarine can hope to defeat Dagoth Ur, he must first destroy the Heart with 'Sunder' and 'Keening'. Upon destroying both Dagoth Ur and the Heart of Lorkhan, the Nerevarine escapes the crumbling cave and surfaces to find the Blight gone and Azura waiting for him or her;</p><blockquote><p><i>\"You no longer bear the burden of prophecy.</i></p><p><i>You have achieved your destiny.</i></p><p><i>You are free.</i></p><p><i>The doomed Dwemer's folly, Lord Dagoth's temptation,</i></p><p><i>the Tribunal's seduction, the god's heart freed,</i></p><p><i>the prophecy fulfilled.</i></p><p><i>All fates sealed and sins redeemed.</i></p><p><i>If you have pity, mourn the loss, but let the weeping cease.</i></p><p><i>The Blight is gone, and the sun's golden honey gilds the land.</i></p><p><i>Hail savior, Hortator, and Nerevarine.</i></p><p><i>Your people look to you for protection.</i></p><p><i>Monster and villains great and small still threaten the people of Vvardenfell.</i></p><p><i>Enemies and evils abound, yet indomitable will might rid Morrowind of all its ills.</i></p><p><i>For you, our thanks and blessings; our gift and token given.</i></p><p><i>Come; take this thing from the hand of god.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>This marks the end of the main story. After Defeating Dagoth Ur and the Heart of Lorkhan, the Nerevarine remains on Vvardenfell to protect and serve the people of Morrowind.</p><p>However, the player does not need to follow the main questline; after leaving the Census they can simple drop all main quest items and never touch the main quest. They can complete side quests for citizens of Vvardenfell in need of help. Alternatively, there are also guilds to join, each of which offer a line of quests of their own.</p><p>Besides the quest storylines, the Elder Scrolls III continues and furthers the deep and detailed fiction, or lore, surrounding <a href=\"/tamriel/3035-92\" data-ref-id=\"3035-92\">Tamriel</a> and Nirn. The Elder Scrolls series is well renowned and praised for its fiction, often being compared to <a href=\"/j-r-r-tolkien/3040-47777\" data-ref-id=\"3040-47777\">Tolkien</a>'s <a href=\"/middle-earth/3035-193\" data-ref-id=\"3035-193\">Middle-Earth</a> in depth and quality of writing.</p><p>For more on the setting, see <a href=\"/nirn/3035-1634\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1634\">Nirn</a>.</p><h2>Side-Quests</h2><p>At any time the player can undertake any number of side-quests. There are hundreds of quests to find in Morrowind. There are three political great house factions and seven lesser guilds. The player can only join one great house, but is free to join any and every lesser guild with the player character. The factions/guilds don't follow a linear story in the same vein as the main quest, but some do have a continuing story over several quests, and often have a set goal and/or \"end-quest\" for the player to work toward. They sometimes even intersect with one another across factions. Aside from the factions/guilds there are many other quests to find in towns, in all the different dungeons and other locations scattered across the map, or just out on the roads and plains.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Players start the game creating a character which they will advance throughout the course of the game. Eleven separate races are available to choose from, each having their own abilities and bonuses. Players can also choose their \"birthsign,\" which also adds bonuses and abilities, before they are released into the world almost immediately after starting the game. Morrowind's completely open world is all available to the player to explore from the moment they disembark from the prison ship, although certain towns and villages must be visited to advance the main quest. Unlike Oblivion, encounters do not scale to match the player's level. As such, it is quite possible to run into impossibly high-level situations as a weak player accidentally, or grind to a high level from the start (which requires a large time investment) and breeze through the low-level content.</p><h2>Races</h2><h3>High Elf</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1360/411890-altmer_official.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-411890\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 220px\" data-ratio=\"1.3409090909091\" data-width=\"220\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1360/411890-altmer_official.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-411890\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1360/411890-altmer_official.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1360/411890-altmer_official.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>High Elf</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/high-elves/3015-3914\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3914\">High Elves</a>, or Altmer in the elven language, are often seen as the most noble race in Tamriel or the most arrogant, depending on the observer.

The game is set two centuries after the end of the Third Era and the closing of the <a href=\"/oblivion-gate/3055-871\" data-ref-id=\"3055-871\">Oblivion gates</a> in <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\">Elder Scrolls IV</a>. Skyrim's gameplay expands on <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\">Oblivion</a> with the addition of dual-wielding, a new perk system, new <a href=\"/thuum/3015-6677\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6677\">Dragon Shout</a> (Thu'um) abilities and a variety of changes to character progression. Additionally, the old quest system has been updated to produce more varied content.</p><h2>Development and Technology</h2><h3>Creation Engine</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712424\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1712424-skyrim8.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/97594/1712424-skyrim8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712424\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/97594/1712424-skyrim8.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Longer draw distances and improved foliage</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"../../todd-howard/72-57173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Todd Howard</a> mentioned on Bethesda's podcast that the ideas for Skyrim took form immediately after Oblivion's launch but principal development began after the release of <a href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\">Fallout 3</a>. It uses a new gameplay and graphics engine, dubbed the <a href=\"/creation-engine/3015-6593\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6593\">Creation Engine</a>, developed internally at Bethesda. The new engine aims to improve draw distances and shadowing on all objects in the world. It also features dynamic weather effects like snow falls and improved animations for trees, like leaves and branches reacting to violent winds. There are also meteorological effects like clouds gathering around mountain tops. Since the new engine incorporates foliage animations, Bethesda has dropped <a href=\"/speedtree/3015-1684\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1684\">SpeedTree</a> for Skyrim.</p><p>Skyrim uses DirectX-9 shaders and is authored on PCs. The PC version contains standard features like higher resolution textures and anti-aliasing, but the engine's graphical development was first done for the Xbox 360. The <a href=\"../../the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-in-motion/17-3831/\" rel=\"nofollow\">first gameplay trailer</a> showed footage from the Xbox 360 version of the game.</p><h3>Animation</h3><p>The game also uses <a href=\"/havok-behavior/3015-6594\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6594\">Havok Behavior</a> for its animations. Howard also <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-08-16-bethesdas-todd-howard-interview?page=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">stated</a> that Bethesda has invested a lot of time and 'people and talent' to improve their animations. Unlike Oblivion, only important NPCs in Skyrim carry unique names and are fully voiced. The extreme close-up dialogue system (seen in previous Bethesda games) has been dropped in favor of a more fluid perspective. <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs</a> no longer stand static on the screen; instead, they continue with their normal routines, occasionally glancing at the player while making conversation. Players can also cut off NPCs by walking away from them mid-conversation.</p><p>For Skyrim, Bethesda took inspiration from various sources. The magic combat was influenced by the plasmids in Irrational Games' <a href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">BioShock</a>. The new deadlier bow-and-arrow mechanic is based on an Oblivion mod that drastically altered the pace of ranged combat by slowing down the draw time for bows. The new menu system was inspired by <a href=\"/apple-inc/3010-5815\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5815\">Apple</a> products and has been drastically changed to be more user friendly. Any item obtained can be viewed in player inventory with a full 3D perspective, and the objects can even be rotated and zoomed in on in order to get a closer look.</p><h3>Art Design</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749789\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1749789-lakemountains.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11986/1749789-lakemountains.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1749789\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11986/1749789-lakemountains.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Skyrim's Nordic art design</figcaption></figure><p>Compared to previous installments in the series, Skyrim's art design has been changed significantly to make the world feel more realistic. Art director <a href=\"/matthew-carofano/3040-57176\" data-ref-id=\"3040-57176\">Matthew Carofano</a> described Skyrim's art design as \"epic reality\" when compared to Oblivion's Imperial cities and \"standard European fantasy\" design. Bethesda aimed to give all the big settlements and quest hubs a unique geographical and architectural setting, offering \"dramatic views.\" There are multiple Nord factions within Skyrim featuring their own unique customs and colors, similar to the different colors and insignias for the towns in Oblivion.</p><h3>Mod Support</h3><p>On February 7th, 2012, Bethesda released a tool called \"Creation Kit,\" for the PC version of Skyrim, allowing players to alter the world of Skyrim in any way that they see fit similar to the Construction Sets for previous Elder Scrolls titles such as <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. The Creation Kit is available as a free download through Steam.</p><p>Steam recently launched the Workshop, a brand new addition to the program, allowing modders to showcase and share their work with other gamers. Skyrim was selected to be one of the very first games featured within the Workshop. To date, there are over 21,000 Skyrim mods that are available in the Steam Workshop. Players can subscribe to any Skyrim mod that they wish to download from the Workshop and once Skyrim is launched, any mods that you subscribed to are automatically downloaded and updated on the Skyrim Launcher. Should a player decide they no longer wish to use a particular mod, they can unsubscribe from the mod in the Workshop and the mod will automatically be uninstalled from the game.</p><p>The distribution of mods is not restricted to just those downloaded through the the Steam Workshop, and can also be downloaded from various community sites such as the <a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/?\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Skyrim Nexus</a>.</p><h2>Setting</h2><h3>Plot</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1684742\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1684742-untitled.png\" data-ratio=\"0.25819826611383\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:25.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1684742-untitled.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1684742\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1684742-untitled.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1684742-untitled.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Prophecy on Alduin's Wall</figcaption></figure><p>Just as foretold in the <a href=\"../../elder-scroll/93-1515/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elder Scrolls</a>, the time for the dragons to return to <a href=\"../../tamriel/95-92/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tamriel</a> has come, led by <a href=\"/alduin/3005-21456\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21456\">Alduin</a>, a dragon of godly proportions whose victory would mean the end of Tamriel. Players take the role of the <a href=\"/dovahkiin/3005-17606\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17606\">Dovahkiin</a>, a person that possesses the power to defy the powerful beasts and absorb their power. There have been several signs indicating the dragons' inevitable return as prophesied by the Elder Scrolls, such as the opening of the Oblivion gates some two centuries ago. The final sign is a Nordic civil war between the Imperial Legion from Cyrodiil, who wish to retain authority their over Skyrim, and the <a href=\"/stormcloaks/3015-7274\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7274\">Stormcloaks</a>, a group of Nordic rebels aiming to remove all Imperial presence from their land. The protagonist starts his/her journey during the said events, and in keeping with Elder Scrolls tradition the player begins as a prisoner. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion.</p><h4>Main Characters</h4><ul><li><a href=\"../../dovahkiin/94-17606/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dovahkiin</a> - The player-created character is the \"Dragonborn\", a man or woman with a sacred power somehow tied into that of the Dragons. They can learn the dragons' language and use magical \"Shouts\", just like the dragons do. Often referred as <a href=\"/dovahkiin/3005-17606\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17606\">the Dragonborn</a> in the game, the Dragonborn is able to permanently kill a dragon by absorbing their soul.</li><li><a href=\"../../esbern/94-17611/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Esbern</a> - One of the last surviving members of the Blades, an elite group of soldiers in service of the Emperor of Tamriel. Esbern is an expert in dragon lore and helps Dovahkiin figure out the mystery behind Alduin's return. He is voiced by <a href=\"../../max-von-sydow/72-99343/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Max Von Sydow</a>.</li><li><a href=\"../../alduin/94-21456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alduin</a> - The world-devouring dragon is the primary antagonist in Skyrim. The \"World-Eater\" is reviving dead dragons all around Skyrim to prepare for his take over.</li><li><a href=\"/arngeir/3005-21457\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21457\">Arngeir</a> - A Greybeard elder, an order of philosopher monks who mastered the Way of the Voice ( <a href=\"/thuum/3015-6677\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6677\">Dragon Shouts</a>). He helps Dovahkiin in understanding Dragon Shouts.</li><li>Delphine - An undercover member of the Blades, investigating the return of the dragons.</li><li><a href=\"/paarthurnax/3005-21458\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21458\">Paarthurnax</a> - Leader of the Greybeards, who guides Dovahkiin in his quest to defeat Alduin.</li></ul><h3>Companions</h3><p>Players will be able to hire/ be given followers, similar to <a href=\"../../fallout-3/61-20504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fallout 3</a> and <a href=\"/fallout-new-vegas/3030-25933\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25933\">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, though they do not have well developed back-stories of their own. Players can have relationships with other characters in the game and get married to any NPC, regardless of their race or sex. These spouses will stay within the confines of the player's house unless asked to do otherwise. Spouses will even cook food, and sleeping next to them will grant various bonuses and perks.</p><p>Followers will follow the player wherever they go in Skyrim. When battling an enemy, they will also take part in the battle, aiding and assisting in anyway they can. Followers can also be used to carry various weapons, apparel, books and other items. This can be accomplished by engaging in conversation with the follower and then selecting the option to trade items with said follower.</p><p>Followers are not immortal and can die should they take to much damage. The same applies to horses.</p><h3>World of Skyrim</h3><p>The world of Skyrim is roughly the same size as Oblivion's <a href=\"/cyrodiil/3035-127\" data-ref-id=\"3035-127\">Cyrodiil</a> (16 square miles), but features a more rugged, mountainous terrain with Nordic architecture and surroundings. The entire realm, however, isn't completely mountainous and snowy; it includes varied environments such as an arctic tundra to lush forests. The world is divided into nine \"holds\" (similar to counties), five of which contain larger cities and the remaining four being rural areas. The in-game world map is rendered in the game engine, giving the impression of a bird's eye view of the world. Skyrim also sees the return of <a href=\"/horse/3015-3114\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3114\">horses</a> as <a href=\"/mounts/3015-409\" data-ref-id=\"3015-409\">mounts</a>, a feature introduced in Oblivion.</p><p>Skyrim contains 150 handcrafted dungeons for players to explore and even more points of interest. The dungeons can get quite complicated, with multiple paths and even puzzles that players must solve to reach other areas of the dungeon.</p><h3>Radiant A.I.</h3><p>The artificial intelligence for both NPCs and creatures has been updated with the aim to create a more believable environment. The general behavior of the NPCs is less static than previous Elder Scrolls titles, as they follow schedules, perform tasks, and adapt to changes in their surroundings. Quest givers often continue with their regular work while talking to players. NPCs can now have specific jobs and will perform those jobs during the day.</p><h3>Radiant Story and Side-Quests</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761587\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1761587-es_5.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1761587-es_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761587\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1761587-es_5.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1761587-es_5.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>NPC interactions have been sharpened for more seamless conversations</figcaption></figure><p>An extension of <a href=\"/radiant-ai/3015-6702\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6702\">Radiant A.I.</a>, Skyrim uses the Radiant Story tool to manage all of the side quests, which incorporates certain aspects of <a href=\"../../procedural-generation/92-328/\" rel=\"nofollow\">procedural generation</a>. The game constantly tracks how players play the game, and modifies side quests to suit their strengths, weaknesses, past experiences, and play-style. For example, a <a href=\"../../kill-quest/92-3184/\" rel=\"nofollow\">kill quest</a> might relocate its target to an unexplored dungeon, making sure players are visiting new and unknown territories. The system is tooled to reduce repetitiveness, making sure the player isn't offered the same type of quest multiple times in a row. Certain quests only unlock if the player reaches a certain level or meets a certain skill requirement such as a high stealth skill. Quests also change based on previous experiences and already completed <a href=\"../../side-quests/92-338/\" rel=\"nofollow\">side quests</a>. Players can also pick up quests by overhearing conversations in taverns.</p><h3>Guilds</h3><p>Skyrim features the same guild structure as previous Elder Scrolls games, but some of them have been given unique names and histories specific to the Skyrim region:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/college-of-winterhold/3015-7299\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7299\">College of Winterhold</a>: Filling the same role as the Mages' Guild in Skyrim, they are located in Winterhold. Their college shares the same name as their guild, <a href=\"/college-of-winterhold/3035-3963\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3963\">College of Winterhold (location).</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-companions/3015-7294\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7294\">The Companions</a>: A Nordic faction that stands-in for the old Fighters Guild. They are located in the guild halll <a href=\"/jorrvaskr/3035-3952\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3952\">Jorrvaskr</a> in the <a href=\"/wind-district/3035-3944\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3944\">Wind district</a> in <a href=\"/whiterun/3035-3901\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3901\">Whiterun</a>. There is also secret group inside the guild, they are called \" <a href=\"/the-circle/3015-7298\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7298\">The Circle</a>\".</li><li><a href=\"/the-thieves-guild/3015-2321\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2321\">Thieves Guild</a>: An organization of thieves located in <a href=\"/riften/3035-3911\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3911\">Riften</a>, a branch of the same organization featured in previous Elder Scrolls games.</li><li><a href=\"/the-dark-brotherhood/3015-2307\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2307\">Dark Brotherhood:</a> A secret group of assassins located in the <a href=\"/dark-brotherhood-sanctuary/3035-3953\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3953\">Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary</a>, related to the organizations of the same name in previous titles.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Skyrim retains the <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-world</a> gameplay and <a href=\"/real-time-combat/3015-2332\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\">real-time combat</a> that has become a hallmark of the Elder Scroll games. Players can explore the world freely and engage in combat in first or third person point of view. The third person point of view has been updated to feel more cinematic with an <a href=\"/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder camera</a> and a minimalistic <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">HUD</a> that only becomes visible during combat. Player attributes have been simplified into three major categories:</p><ul><li><b>Health -</b> Increases player health</li><li><b>Stamina -</b> Governs the use of melee and ranged attacks. Players can also sprint by expending stamina. Increasing stamina also increases encumbrance limit.</li><li><b>Magicka -</b> Governs the use of magic spells and attacks. Also increases resistance to magic.</li></ul><p>Skyrim contains nine major cities and various small settlements spread throughout the Nordic countryside, where players can interact with the townsfolk, pick up quests or carry out activities such as cooking, farming, woodcutting etc. There are over 150 dungeons within Skyrim, that contain creatures who scale with player level. According to Bethesda, Skyrim's <a href=\"/level-scaling/3015-608\" data-ref-id=\"3015-608\">level scaling</a> is similar to Fallout 3 and not Oblivion. As a result, minor creatures like rats won't become exceedingly powerful at higher levels. Also, once the player visits a dungeon, the creatures within get locked to a certain level for the rest of the campaign.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1703557\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1703557-tes51_1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1703557-tes51_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1703557\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1703557-tes51_1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1703557-tes51_1.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Dual wielding weapon and magic</figcaption></figure><p>Players can bind independent weapons and spells to both hands. This allows for dual-wielding diverse weapons and even spells to create unique combos. Spells can be bound on one hand, while wielding a weapon in the other. However, only players using a 2-handed weapon, a shield and a weapon, or a shield and a spell can <a href=\"/block/3015-1843\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1843\">block</a> incoming attacks. Items and abilities can be switched during combat through a pop-up favorites menu, as opposed to the directional pad mapping in Oblivion.</p><p>The run speed while going backwards has been reduced to cut down on \"cheap tricks\" and improve the visual experience. Howard mentions that running backward at full speed in Oblivion \"looked ridiculous\" in third person. <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">Stealth</a> has also been modified to give players a small window of opportunity to hide upon detection.</p><p>Attacks gravitate towards enemies to reduce the possibility of friendly fire. In addition, all three types of attacks have been modified in the following manner:</p><ul><li><b>Melee -</b> While retaining the hack'n'slash nature seen in previous games, the melee combat has been updated with finishing moves and kill animations unique to each weapon and opponent. Staggering enemies and positional attacks are important to the core combat. Weapon-specific perks increase their respective effectiveness. For example: sword perks increase the critical strike rate, axe perks results in a bleeding effect, mace perks provide armor penetration and shield perks improve spell resistance.</li><li><b>Ranged -</b> Ranged combat still relies on bows and arrows, but the draw time for the bow has been slowed down, resulting in heavier damage per shot. Archers can use bash moves to gain distance between themselves and their targets. They can also hold their breath now to gain accuracy at the cost of stamina.</li><li><b>Magic -</b> Players have to equip spells in weapon slots to use them in combat, forcing a choice between magic or melee proficiency. The spell mechanics have been changed accordingly to allow use of magic in close combat and each magic spell can be used in varied manners. For example, the fire spell can be dual-wielded to produce a giant bomb-like effect; or used as a flame thrower in a short arc; or place runes on the ground to create a fire trap.</li></ul><h2>Spell Schools</h2><p>The number of spell schools have been reduced from six (in Oblivion) to five after the removal of Mysticism, which was deemed redundant and folded into the remaining schools:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/alteration/3015-2822\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2822\">Alteration</a></li><li><a href=\"/conjuration/3015-5729\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5729\">Conjuration</a></li><li><a href=\"/evocation/3015-5737\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5737\">Destruction</a></li><li><a href=\"/illusion/3015-5734\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5734\">Illusion</a></li><li><a href=\"/healer/3015-188\" data-ref-id=\"3015-188\">Restoration</a></li></ul><h3>Conjuration</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Spell Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Novice</td><td>Bound Sword</td><td>Creates a magic sword for 120 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Novice</td><td>Conjure Familiar</td><td>Summons a Familiar for 60 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Novice</td><td>Raise Zombie</td><td>Reanimate a weak dead body to fight for you for 60 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>Bound Battleaxe</td><td>Creates a magic battle axe for 120 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>Conjure <a href=\"/flame-atronach/3015-3082\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3082\">Flame Atronach</a></td><td>Summons a Flame Atronach for 60 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>Reanimate Corpse</td><td>Reanimate a more powerful dead body to fight for you for 60 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>Soul Trap</td><td>Soul traps If a target dies within 60 seconds, fills a soul gem.</td></tr><tr><td>Adept</td><td>Banish <a href=\"/daedra/3015-1826\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1826\">Daedra</a></td><td>Weaker summoned daedra are sent back to Oblivion.</td></tr><tr><td>Adept</td><td>Bound Bow</td><td>Creates a magic bow for 120 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Adept</td><td>Conjure <a href=\"/frost-atronach/3015-3083\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3083\">Frost Atronach</a></td><td>Summons a Frost Atronach to fight for you for 60 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Adept</td><td>Revenant</td><td>Reanimate a powerful dead body to fight for you for 60 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Expert</td><td>Command Daedra</td><td>Powerful summoned and raised creatures are put under your control.</td></tr><tr><td>Expert</td><td>Conjure <a href=\"/dremora/3015-3551\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3551\">Dremora</a> Lord</td><td>Summons a Dremora Lord for 120 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Expert</td><td>Conjure <a href=\"/storm-atronach/3015-3085\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3085\">Storm Atronach</a></td><td>Summons a Frost Atronach for 60 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td>Expert</td><td>Dread Zombie</td><td>Reanimate a very powerful dead body to fight for you.</td></tr><tr><td>Expert</td><td>Expel Daedra</td><td>Powerful summoned daedra are sent back to Oblivion.</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>Dead Thrall</td><td>Reanimate a dead body permanently to fight for you.</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>Flame Thrall</td><td>Summons a Flame Atronach permanently.</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>Frost Thrall</td><td>Summons a Frost Atronach permanently.</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>Storm Thrall</td><td>Summons a Storm Atronach permanently.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Destruction</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Spell Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Novice</td><td>Flames</td><td>A gout of fire inflicting a base damage of 8 points of fire damage per second.</td></tr><tr><td>Novice</td><td>Frostbite</td><td>A blast of cold inflicting a base damage of 8 points of frost damage per second to Health and Stamina.</td></tr><tr><td>Novice</td><td>Sparks</td><td>Lightning which inflicts a base damage of 8 points of shock damage per second to Health and Magicka.</td></tr><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>Firebolt</td><td>A bolt of fire that inflicts 25 points of fire damage.

With the return of Alduin, a big focus is on dragon encounters. They are the most feared creatures in the game and each encounter is akin to a <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss fight</a>. Howard <a href=\"http://gamerant.com/elder-scrolls-skyrim-dragon-details-dyce-64808/\" rel=\"nofollow\">described</a> them as, \"a mix between a <a href=\"/big-daddy/3015-624\" data-ref-id=\"3015-624\">Big Daddy</a> and a helicopter in <a href=\"/half-life-2/3030-1539\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1539\">Half-life 2</a>\". Using Dragon Shouts, they can speak directly to the Dragonborn.</p><p>Players face different races and types of dragons, either alone or in small groups. These encounters can be in the wilderness, within a city, or in a town. During these encounters, the dragons will frequently circle the player utilizing it's unique \"breath\" attacks. While on ground, they will engage the player in direct melee combat.</p><h3>Dragon Shouts (Thu'um)</h3><p>Throughout the game, players can acquire Dragon Shouts, which are rare and powerful abilities. This skillset is learned through the \"Way of the Voice\" and is separate from magic and more closely related to battle cries. Players learn these abilities by learning the words from one of the game's word walls, often hidden in dungeons or other hard to reach areas. They then \"unlock\" the words they want by killing a dragon and absorbing its soul. These shouts are unique to <a href=\"/dovahkiin/3005-17606\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17606\">the Dragonborn</a> and the players character is one of the few in the world capable of using them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1717386\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1717386-wmplayer_2011_02_24_11_30_06_56.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1717386-wmplayer_2011_02_24_11_30_06_56.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1717386\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1717386-wmplayer_2011_02_24_11_30_06_56.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1717386-wmplayer_2011_02_24_11_30_06_56.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The protagonist learning a Dragon Shout</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the 20 Dragon Shouts are made up of three unique words, with each word representing a power level of the shout. An example can be seen in the first gameplay trailer where Dovahkiin yells \u201cFus, Ro, Dah!\u201d (at 1:08 mark); Fus meaning force, Ro meaning balance and Dah meaning push, the result of which is a mighty shockwave. These words are in Bethesda's dragon language, created specifically for this purpose, with fonts designed as if a creature with three talons (i.e. dragon) could write them. The language has been designed to rhyme both in its original version and in English. The first example of this was the Nordic choir used towards the end of the teaser trailer.</p><h4>Known Dragon Shouts:</h4><ul><li>Whirlwind Sprint (WULD NAH KEST): Gives the player a quick burst of speed to get past deadly obstacles or enemies. It also allows crossing of small abysses.</li><li>Fire Breath (YOL TOOR SHUL): Allows the player to breath fire like a dragon.</li><li>Slow Motion (TIID KLO UL): Slows down time briefly.</li><li>Unrelenting Force (FUS RO DAH): Push back enemies.</li><li>Storm Call (STRUN BAH QO): Creates a storm that zaps enemies with lightning.</li><li>Elemental Fury (SU GRAH DUN): Shouts at weapon to make attacks faster.</li><li>Ice Form (IIZ SLEN NUS): Encases enemies in a block of ice.</li><li>Dragon Call (OD AH VIING): Summon a dragon ally to assist the player.</li><li>Animal allegiance (RAAN MIR TAH): Summon beasts to help players in combat.</li><li>Become Ethereal (FEIM ZI GRON): Makes the player immune to damage but also, unable to attack.</li><li>Frost Breath (FO KRAH DIIN): Cold ice damage breath.</li><li>Throw Voice (ZUL MEY GUT): Make enemies think you are somewhere else allowing you to regain stealth.</li><li>Disarm (ZUN HAAL VIIK): Disarms enemies.</li><li>Clear Skies (LOK VAH KOOR): Clears skies.</li><li>Call of Valor (HUN KAAR ZOOL): Summons heroes to help players in combat.</li><li>Dragonrend (JOOR ZAH FRUL): Forces the dragon to land.</li><li>Marked for Death (KRII LUN AUS): Damage max health and stamina of target.</li><li>Aura Whisper (LAAS YA NIR): Detect life.</li><li>Kyne's Peace (KAAN DREM OV): Creature(s) lose the will to fight or flee.</li><li>Dismaying Shout (FAAS RU MAAR): Enemies flee from the player.</li><li>Bend Will (GOL HAH DOV): Purges All-Maker stones, makes people allies, taming and riding dragons.</li><li>Battle Fury (MID VUR SHAAN):</li><li>Cyclone (VEN GAAR NOS): Send a cyclone in an upward motion towards enemies.</li><li>Dragon Aspect (MUL QAH DIIV): Using ethreal dragon armor for a period of time.</li><li>Drain Vitality (GAAN LAH HAAS):</li><li>Soul Tear (RII VAAZ ZOL): Rips out an enemy's soul.</li><li>Summon Durnehviir (DUR NEH VIIR): Summons the undead dragon, Durnehviir for a temporary period.

Like previous Elder Scroll games, players become more proficient with a skill by simply using it more often. But this time, the major/minor skill classification has been dropped in favor of a more flexible system. Each level increase allows the player to improve their health, magicka, or stamina.</p><p>Leveling is affected by all skills. The higher the skill, the more it contributes to leveling. Raising a certain skill from 30 to 31 can level up a character faster than raising another from 10 to 11, for example. As a result, players can still specialize in any of the 18 available skills and continue leveling at a good pace. Every skill can be raised up to 100. The game doesn't have a level cap, but the progression is designed on a 1 to 50 level curve (as opposed to the 1-25 curve in Oblivion). The aim of the longer curve is to give players more choice and support more divergent archetypes as they progress.</p><p>With the 1.9 Skyrim Update, a new feature called Legendary Skills was released, which lets you make Skills \"Legendary\". This will reset the skills to 15, reset all perks, and refund the perk points, which allows the skill to affect levelling again. This removes the overall level cap, which allows you to level up almost infinitely.</p><h3>Perks</h3><p>Like Fallout 3, players also get the choice of a <a href=\"/perks/3015-366\" data-ref-id=\"3015-366\">perk</a> on each level up. These perks are special power-ups tied to the skill system and allow mastery of abilities, weapons etc. Some perks have tiered levels, allowing players to choose them again, usually with added bonuses.

Todd Howard's idea for the score was \"The Elder Scrolls theme, but sung by a barbarian choir\". A developer diary by sound engineer <a href=\"../../mark-lampert/72-90562/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark Lampert</a> <a href=\"http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/01/14/the-sounds-of-skyrim.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">revealed</a> that Skyrim's resultant main theme (called \"Sons of Skyrim\") picks various elements from past themes like Nerevar Rising (Morrowind) and Reign of the Septims (Oblivion), with a Nordic choir layered on top to give it the heavier and more brutal sound Howard required. The music also makes heavy use of drums and chanting to distinguish itself from previous iterations. For the choir, Bethesda recorded about 30 people multiple times and then synced them in post-processing to create the final effect of a 90+ choir.</p><p>The final soundtrack will be released on a massive four-disc set, available initially through Soule's own Directsong service and eventually on iTunes as well.</p><h2>Announcement</h2><p>On December 11, 2010, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was announced during the <a href=\"../../spike-video-game-awards-2010/92-6348/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spike TV Video Game Awards</a>. Todd Howard took the stage during the awards show to show a teaser trailer that referenced Oblivion's ending.

Bethesda has since begun the process of releasing patches to fix such issues. However, while Patch 1.2 fixed issues such as a bug in the Xbox 360 version that prevented high resolution textures from loading when the game was installed, it also caused problems of its own. The patch broke all magic resistances, rendering them null. Dragons populating the game world would also sometimes fly backwards. Bethesda plans to fix these new problems and other issues in upcoming patches. Another bug that Bethesda is currently attempting to fix that is specific to the PS3 version affects the game's framerate. The longer the player plays the game and the larger the save file becomes, the more likely it is for the player to experience significant framerate drops.</p><p>Bethesda also plans to release the official SDK, the Creation Kit, for mod development in January, 2012. The Creation Kit will use Steam Workshop, so users can pick and download mods directly from their Steam interface. The Creation Kit was released in February, 2012, one month later than expected.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is one of the most universally acclaimed games of this generation. It achieved both critical and commercial success.</p><p>Skyrim has an average score of 96/100 on Metacritic (Xbox 360 version). Beyond the high score reviews, Skyrim was awarded 2011 Game Of The Year by multiple renowned publications, such as 1UP, Game Informer, Gamespot and our own Giant Bomb.</p><p>Skyrim sales number were also through the roof, with 7 million copies shipped worldwide on the 1st week, and more than 10 million by the end of 2011. <a href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve</a> also announced that Skyrim was the fastest selling game to date on their <a href=\"/steam/3015-718\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a> platform.</p><h2>DLC</h2><p>Bethesda announced that they would be developing DLC for Skyrim before the gam was released. It entered into a contract with Microsoft for three timed exclusives, meaning three DLCs would first be released on Xbox 360 and made available for other platforms later. Bethesda indicated that their DLC would have more substance like later releases for Oblivion and Fallout 3, though smaller DLC would still appear in between larger ones. Possible features of future DLC were teased in a video entitled \"Skyrim Jam\", some of which have already made it into DLC such as Vampire Lords and house construction.</p><p>Notably, none of the DLC released so far have been made available for the PS3. When Dawnguard was released, Bethesda announced that they were unable to get it to work with Skyrim and said they were working with SCEA to get it working. The same issue came up with Hearthfire, which has yet to be released for PS3 either. As of November, Bethesda has still been unable to get the DLC working for PS3 users.</p><h3>Dawnguard</h3><p>Speculation on the first DLC began shortly after the release of patch Patch 1.5.26 in April, which contained references to new animations and other content prefixed with \"DLC01_\". Bethesda formally announced Dawnguard in May 2012 with the release of a trailer. It was released on June 26th for the Xbox 360 for 1600 MS points, and later for the PC on August 2nd through Steam for $19.99. Called Dawnguard, the expansion pack comes with new gameplay features, locations, and content. The plot introduces a vampire lord named Harkon, who seeks to \"end the tyranny of the sun\" (referring to the weaknesses that vampires have while in the sunlight). A group of vampire hunters, called the Dawnguard set out to stop him. The player can choose which faction to support, with both routes open to vampires and vampire hunters.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"large\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2282890\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76708/2282890-Skyrim-Dawnguard-beta-testers-talk-vampires.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.55\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/76708/2282890-Skyrim-Dawnguard-beta-testers-talk-vampires.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2282890\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/7/76708/2282890-Skyrim-Dawnguard-beta-testers-talk-vampires.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/7/76708/2282890-Skyrim-Dawnguard-beta-testers-talk-vampires.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Vampire Perk Tree</figcaption></figure><p>The player has the option to become a vampire lord him/herself, or remain a werewolf. Each path has it's own unique skill trees and abilities, which one levels up by slaying enemies while in their respective forms. The expansion introduces Dragonbone weapons, which are stronger than their daedric counterparts, arrow crafting, and crossbows for the player to use. Horse-mounted combat is also featured in this add-on, as well as new dragon shouts, weapons, and armor for the player.</p><p>The add-on introduces a new type of dragon, known as legendary dragons, which far surpass the skill of the previous highest level of dragon (elder dragons).</p><p>The main quest takes the player to some new locations in Skyrim, and reveals more about the mysterious past of the race known as the Falmer. The story also gives further meaning and explanation to the Elder Scrolls, their purpose, their origin, and what makes them so special, and above all, dangerous.</p><p>The add-on introduces a new member of the Thieves Guild, who can be found in the Ragged Flagon, who will change the player's appearance for a mere 1000 gold.</p><h3>Hearthfire</h3><p>Hearthfire was released on September 4, 2012 for the Xbox 360, priced at 400 MS points, and on October 4th, 2012 on PC through Steam for $4.99. Hearthfire is a small DLC, allowing the player to involve themselves in the construction of three possible homes by gathering the necessary supplies. Once built, the house can be expanded with three possible wings. The player can hire NPCs to carry out duties in their new house and also receive a Housecarl from the Jarl of the hold they constructed their home in. Hearthfire also makes it possible to adopt children in the game, who can be housed in any of the new homes as well as the existing ones in Skyrim. Small radiant quests are also added, giving the player tasks such as defending their home from a bandit raid or giant attack.</p><h3>Dragonborn</h3><p>Like with Dawnguard, speculation for the third DLC began with the release of Patch 1.8 for beta testing on October 24th. The patch contained references to new locations, animations, and armors prefixed with \"DLC02\". On November 4th, Bethesda announced the DLC with the release of a trailer, with a release date of December 4th for the Xbox 360 priced at 1600 MS points. Like with Dawnguard and Hearthfire, Dragonborn is a timed exclusive. Bethesda has not commented on the features of Dragonborn directly, but the trailer indicates the player will travel to the island Solstheim which was previously featured in the Morrowind expansion, Bloodmoon. The island will contain new locations, including refugee sites set up by Dunmer after the eruption of the Red Mountain, and see the return of Rieklings, a common enemy from Bloodmoon. The main quest will concern itself with Miraak on the island who is described as the \"first\" Dragonborn.</p><h2>English to Dragon Language Converter</h2><p>Using the English alphabet as a common language its possible to translate common English words into their Dragon equivalent.</p><p>For a full list see the following Giant Bomb guide table (link) which outlines the English to Dragon conversions.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><p><b><strong>Minimum System </strong>Requirements</b></p><ul><li>Windows 7/Vista/XP PC (32 or 64 bit)</li><li>Processor: Dual Core 2.0GHz or equivalent processor</li><li>2GB System RAM</li><li>6GB free HDD Space</li><li>Direct X 9 compliant video card with 512 MB of RAM</li><li>DirectX compatible sound card</li><li>Internet access for Steam activation</li></ul><p><b><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong></b></p><ul><li>Windows 7/Vista/XP PC (32 or 64 bit)</li><li>Processor: Quad-core Intel or AMD CPU</li><li>4GB System RAM</li><li>6GB free HDD space</li><li>DirectX 9 compatible NVIDIA or AMD ATI video card with 1GB of RAM (Nvidia GeForce GTX 260 or higher; ATI Radeon 4890 or higher).</li><li>DirectX compatible sound card</li><li>Internet access for Steam activation</li></ul><h2>External Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.elderscrolls.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Official Website</a></li><li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/ElderScrolls\" rel=\"nofollow\">Official Twitter account</a></li></ul>", "deck": "The fifth installment in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls franchise is set in the eponymous province of Skyrim, where the ancient threat of dragons, led by the sinister Alduin, is rising again to threaten all mortal races.

Developed and published by <a href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786\" data-ref-id=\"3010-786\">Bethesda Softworks</a>, it was released on October 28, 2008 on the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>; the game takes place approximately thirty years after the events in <a href=\"/fallout-2/3030-5559\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5559\">Fallout 2</a>. Although set in the same universe, Fallout 3 takes place in the <a href=\"/the-capital-wasteland/3035-2158\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2158\">Capital Wasteland</a> in and around the <a href=\"/washington-dc/3035-255\" data-ref-id=\"3035-255\">Washington D.C.</a> area, rather than California. The game blends design elements and approaches from both the Fallout and <a href=\"/elder-scrolls/3025-174\" data-ref-id=\"3025-174\">Elder Scrolls</a> franchises, resulting in fan debate about Fallout 3's legitimacy as a \"real\" Fallout game.</p><p>Like <a href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\">Oblivion</a>, enemies and items spawn relative to the player's current level. This keeps the difficulty of the game consistent, along with opening the majority of the game up to the player from the beginning. This is a change from the previous Fallout games, which featured zones that posed a huge risk to a low-level character if visited too early by the player. However, the system is markedly different from that of Oblivion in that, once an area is discovered, the environment is locked down to the level at which the player found it, preventing unrealistic jumps in enemy levels over the course of the game.</p><p>Bethesda supported the game post-release with a number of <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">downloadable content</a> packs. Most of the pieces took place outside of the <a href=\"/the-wasteland/3035-777\" data-ref-id=\"3035-777\">Wasteland</a>. The downloadable content was initially exclusive to the Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game, but was later released on the PlayStation 3.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/780737-screenshot27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-780737\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1326/780737-screenshot27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-780737\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1326/780737-screenshot27.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>V.A.T.S. in action</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the real-time first person action, Fallout 3 introduced a feature called <a href=\"/vault-tec-assisted-targeting-system/3015-1807\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1807\">V.A.T.S</a>. (<b>V</b>ault-Tec <b>A</b>ssisted <b>T</b>argeting <b>S</b>ystem) which pauses the game and allows the character to queue attacks on specific enemy body parts while calculating the odds of each shot hitting the target. The percentage chance of a hit and the damage done by each queued attack depend on several factors including player level, distance from target, perks obtained and skills, and weapon used. Each shot queued in V.A.T.S. requires a certain number of action points (AP) depending on weapon power; expending slightly less than a quarter with a single shot with some pistols, while expending them all with weapons such as the Fat Man. After use, the AP must then regenerate in real-time. However, continued combat in real-time while they are regenerating will cause them to fill up slower. Players can also take Jet, a Chem that briefly increases the amount of AP available to their character.</p><h3>Health &amp; Item Degradation</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6843/870170-deathclaw_model.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870170\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.3875338753388\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6843/870170-deathclaw_model.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870170\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6843/870170-deathclaw_model.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Shoot their legs to slow them down</figcaption></figure><p>When taking damage, the player's general health or limb health may be affected. General health meaning, of course, the life bar that shrinks as they take damage. However, Fallout 3 also has a specific limb system in place that can affect several things. Each limb has its own health bar, and when a player takes damage to that limb, it may become crippled. A crippled limb will affect certain things depending on which limb it is. For example, if the player has a crippled leg, they will walk much slower. If one of their arms is crippled, their accuracy will suffer. If the head gets crippled, the perception (ability to see enemies on the compass/radar) will decrease. The crippled system means that shooting for the head in V.A.T.S. may not always be the best idea. An example of this would be for <a href=\"/deathclaw/3015-1650\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1650\">Deathclaws</a>. Deathclaws are extremely fast and strong opponents, so shooting and crippling their legs will prevent them from getting close. <a href=\"/stimpak/3055-1133\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1133\">Stimpaks</a> can be applied to individual limbs (rather than used to heal general health) to fix them.</p><p>Radiation is also common in Fallout 3. Food and untreated water will give the player small amounts of radiation when they are consumed. There are also areas throughout the game that may be contaminated, such as nasty radiation pools, that will affect the player. The effects of radiation exposure are cumulative, and after being exposed beyond certain thresholds of tolerance, the player will get different levels of radiation sickness. The sicknesses will affect the players stats, or can kill the player if it's untreated and builds to extreme levels, although certain perks mitigate the penalties or even provide benefits through mutation such as repairing broken limbs when suffering from advanced radiation poisoning. Radiation levels can be reduced or brought back to zero by using certain medicines or getting treated by a doctor or home medical station.</p><p>Another very important aspect of the game is item degradation. Equipped armor and weapons will become damaged over time. The condition is represented by a bar. As an item becomes more and more damaged, it becomes less effective. Weapons lose damage and jam, and armor loses damage resistance. Items can be repaired by using parts of another item that is the same (for example, an assault rifle can be repaired by using parts of another assault rifle) or by paying certain people to do it. The repair skill dictates how much the player can repair their equipment (up to a certain percentage of full condition).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419592\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 115px\" data-ratio=\"0.78260869565217\" data-width=\"115\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419592\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/88339/1419592-psycho_f2.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Just like real life, take it easy with the Chems</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout their travels, players will encounter Chems (also known as drugs in the real world) that can be used to affect their performance. There are several different kinds, and if used too much, the player may become addicted. This leads to negative withdrawal symptoms if they don't take some of the drugs they are addicted to at regular intervals. The player can also become addicted to alcohol, and addictions can be cured by a doctor.</p><h3>Interaction</h3><p>Fallout 3 features an extensive dialogue system in which players can interact with almost every <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPC</a> in the game. Players are presented with multiple lines of speech to choose from, and the person they are talking to will react accordingly to the one they choose. Most dialogue options will have a \"good\" line and a \"bad\" line. Through interactions, players can pick up quests and gain information. They also have the potential to talk themselves out of certain situations. Occasionally, players are presented with a Speech challenge, represented by a dialog option marked \"Speech\" with a percentage next to it. The percentage represents the player's chance of success, based on their current Speech level. If they succeed, the player can often gain information about whatever they are talking about. If they fail, they will get nothing from it. Passing a Speech challenge also awards the player with <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a>.</p><h3>Lockpicking and Hacking</h3><p>Lockpicking and hacking are two ways of accessing areas, containers, information, or functions that would otherwise be inaccessible. Each is associated with a skill (Lockpicking and Science), dictating whether the player can attempt each of the 5 difficulty levels of locks and terminals (Very Easy, Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard). The player can also attempt to force the lock.</p><p>The player can try to pick locks on many objects throughout the Wasteland, including doors, ammunition boxes, and safes. Having at least one <a href=\"/bobby-pin/3055-1744\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1744\">bobby pin</a> is required to pick a lock.</p><h4>Lockpicking Minigame</h4><p>The game will pause and an image of the lock will appear along with a bobby pin and a screwdriver. Using the left stick, the player can move the bobby pin around the keyhole. With the right stick, the player applies torque to the bobby pin to try and open it. If in the right spot, the lock will completely turn. If in the wrong spot, the lock will stop and the controller will vibrate. If one continues moving the bobby pin down in the same direction and the lock stops sooner, one is going the wrong way.</p><p>Hacking is less frequent than lockpicking and is a bit more difficult. Computers that must be hacked can contain backstory or important quest-related info, or allow environment-related functions like unlocking doors or deactivating <a href=\"/turret/3055-43\" data-ref-id=\"3055-43\">turrets</a>.</p><h4>Hacking Minigame</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-621291\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-621291\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/621291-vlcsnap_4617300.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Hacking a terminal</figcaption></figure><p>When the player chooses an incorrect password, they'll see a fraction on the screen like 2/9 correct. This does not just mean that two of the letters are correct; rather, two of the letters are in the correct position. For example, suppose that the real password is FALLOUT. The player chooses ROLLOUT, and is 5/7 correct, because LLOUT is in the same position in both words. Conversely, if EFFECTS was chosen, it would be 0/7 correct, because while it shares letters with FALLOUT, none of the positions are the same. Some groups of characters are inside square brackets or parentheses. If the player clicks on these groups of characters, the terminal will either remove one incorrect password from the screen or it will replenish the amount of attempts. By doing this, the player can sometimes narrow down the amount of choices to just one word, allowing them to unlock the computer within a minute.</p><h3>Karma</h3><p>The <a href=\"/reputation/3015-2741\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2741\">Karma</a> system implemented in Fallout 3 rates the player's actions throughout the game and portrays them as either a Good, Neutral, or Evil character depending on their choices. For instance, stealing, killing innocents and generally being horrible will earn bad Karma resulting in an Evil character.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247102\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.36\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:36.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247102\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1247102-1156109_800px_karmaf3_super.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Karma Levels range from Very Evil to Very Good</figcaption></figure><p>Whereas good deeds, such as helping hobos and treating people well will result in positive Karma and a Good character. A balance of these actions means the character will stay neutral. Many quests have different outcomes, and the player can usually choose which of these to pursue. The easiest way to do something often ends up with a lot of dead people and bad Karma, but the more skill based, reasonable or long winded methods usually have a reward of positive Karma. Being a Good character leads to helpful items and such from Neutral or Good NPCs, and vice versa for evil characters. The flip side to this is that evil or good characters will also run into heavily-armed hit groups with a contract for their head. Also, the karma status of the player can determine what kind of followers they can acquire. For example, Evil characters get <a href=\"/jericho/3005-8651\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8651\">Jericho</a> and Clover, Good characters get <a href=\"/fawkes/3005-8633\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8633\">Fawkes</a> and <a href=\"/star-paladin-cross/3005-9399\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9399\">Star Paladin Cross</a>, and Neutral characters get <a href=\"/butch/3005-9245\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9245\">Butch</a> and <a href=\"/sergeant-rl-3/3005-9384\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9384\">Sergeant RL-3</a>. The player's Karma is points based and starts at zero. As the player performs Good and Evil actions they are evaluated and given the appropriate status:</p><h3>Actions that alter Karma</h3><ul><li>Killing an Evil character or creature: No gain or loss in Karma</li><li>Killing a very Evil character or creature: 100 Karma gain</li><li>Killing a good creature: -50 Karma</li><li>Killing a good person: -100 Karma</li><li>Stealing: -5/item</li><li>Good act during a quest: 50</li><li>Evil act during a quest: -50</li><li>Consuming a dead body: -1 (Perk needed)</li></ul><h3>Karma Classification</h3><p>Based on the number of points, the Karma system classifies the player as:</p><ul><li>Below -750 : Very Evil</li><li>-750 to -250: Evil</li><li>-250 to 250: Neutral</li><li>250 to 750: Good</li><li>Above 750: Very Good</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the Vault Dweller will be given a title based on their karma and current level, with Neutral, Evil and Good Karma titles unique for each level. There are 30 different Karma levels in Fallout 3.</p><h3>S.P.E.C.I.A.L.

It is a set of seven attributes that govern each of the game's skills, as well as certain character stats. They are first encountered during early childhood, when the player finds a picture book called \"You're SPECIAL\" and assigns points to the SPECIAL attributes. Each one starts at a level of 5, and at this moment the player is asked to split up a further 5 total points between the skills. There is little use in leveling one attribute up to 10, because then it cannot be improved later in the game. SPECIAL can't exceed 10 or drop lower than 1, so if they reach these caps even if an item is equipped or a chem or foodstuff consumed that could add a point to one of them, there will be no change.</p><p>SPECIAL stands for:</p><ul><li><b>Strength</b><br />Affects: Melee Weapons, Carry Weight, Melee damage bonus</li><li><b>Perception<br /></b>Affects: Explosives, Lock-pick, Energy Weapons, minimum distance for red compass markers</li><li><b>Endurance<br /></b>Affects: Hit Points, Poison Resistance, Radiation Resistance, Big Guns, Unarmed, oxygen counter when diving</li><li><b>Charisma<br /></b>Affects: NPC disposition towards player, Barter, Speech</li><li><b>Intelligence<br /></b>Affects: Number of new skill points per level, Medicine, Repair, Science</li><li><b>Agility<br /></b>Affects: Action Points available for V.A.T.S., Small Guns, Sneak</li><li><b>Luck<br /></b>Affects: All skills, Critical chance, Accuracy, random encounters</li></ul><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills dictate the player character's effectiveness in specific elements of gameplay. They are affected by the player's SPECIAL stats, as well as certain equipment, perks, and temporary effects. The player is asked to \"tag\" three skills at the beginning of the game, which grants a bonus of fifteen points to each.</p><p>While Fallout 1 and 2 both had 18 skills in total, Fallout 3 reduces the number to 13, partly by merging similar skills - Doctor and First Aid are replaced by a general Medicine skill, for instance, and disarming traps is governed by Explosives or Repair, rather than a dedicated Traps skill. The Gambling and Outdoorsman skills are not carried forward in any form.</p><p>A Vault Boy bobblehead for each skill can be found hidden somewhere in the game world, adding 10 points to that skill when used.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Skill</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618027-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618027\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 150px\" data-ratio=\"0.74666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618027-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618027\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618027-1.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618027-1.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Barter</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects prices when trading with merchants.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618028-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618028\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 150px\" data-ratio=\"0.74666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618028-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618028\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618028-1.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618028-1.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Big Guns</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects damage done with Big Guns (Fat Man, Flamer, Minigun, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618031-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618031\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 150px\" data-ratio=\"0.74666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618031-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618031\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618031-1.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618031-1.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Energy Weapons</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects damage done with Energy Weapons (Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle, Plasma Rifle, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618037-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618037\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 150px\" data-ratio=\"0.74666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618037-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618037\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618037-1.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618037-1.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Explosives</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects explosives damage (Frag grenades, plasma grenades, landmines, etc.) as well as the ability of handling explosive traps.</td></tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618036-_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618036\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 150px\" data-ratio=\"0.74666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1618036-_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618036\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618036-_.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1618036-_.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Lockpick</figcaption></figure></td><td>Affects which level of locks can be picked (easy, average, hard).

gained every level rather than every three like the old games (hence the original Fallout's level cap of 21 the nearest multiple of three to 20). Since the Traits system has been removed which gave both positive and negative effects to the player, some of them were incorporated in to the available perks.</p><p>There are about 58 perks total in the original release of Fallout 3. Most of the perks range from simple skill increases like Gun Nut (which increases small guns and repair by 5), but there are other unique perks that range from things like Lead Belly (50% less radiation from radiated water sources), to Lawbringer (Enemies' ears are lootable and can be turned in for karma). Also, each perk has it's own set of requirements of either skill, SPECIAL stats, or both.</p><p>There are also exclusive, and missable, quest perks that can only be obtained by completing quests.

The main character will begin by finding a standard array of basic weapons, like pistols, knives, and assault rifles. As the game progresses, however, players will find many unique weapons like the Alien Blaster, Lincoln's Repeater, and Mesmetron. These exotic weapons keep in tone with the 1950's sci-fi theme present in the Fallout universe.</p><h3>Random Encounters</h3><p>While exploring the Wasteland, the player may experience a random event/encounter.

Followed shortly after by the death of the character's mother, who dies in childbirth due to cardiac arrest, the story then jumps ahead to when the character begins walking. This is the first introduction to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, allowing for further character customization. Shortly after, the player enters their 10th birthday party, where they receive their Pip-Boy. Following a few altercations, the player reaches age 16 and takes the G.O.A.T. exam, determining their skills. Another advance occurs, and the player is awoken by Amata, who informs the character that their father, James, has left the vault without warning and under mysterious circumstances. This desertion attracts the ire of The Overseer, who attempts to apprehend the player character for questioning through his security force. The player fights their way to the father's lab, where they find the body of Jonas. In that lab, the player receives a message from their father, explaining that he had to leave and they should not follow. After persevering further through the vault, the player encounters Amata being questioned (or tortured) by her father. After securing her escape, the player learns of a secret exit through the Overseer's office, and fights their way to the exit. After leaving the vault, they venture out into an utterly destroyed Washington DC, though the wasteland is far from lifeless.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941318\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941318\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17450/941318-400px_threedog.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Three Dog has info about James, but wants a favor in return </figcaption></figure><p>The first town the Lone Wanderer runs across is the town of Megaton, a gated community built in a crater around an unexploded atomic bomb. It is here that the player is given the choice to either disarm the undetonated bomb for their father's whereabouts from Lucas Simms, or pay off Colin Moriarty. Eventually, they learn that James ventured into the ruins of Washington DC, searching for a radio station, called Galaxy News Radio, located within. Following a perilous journey into the city, the player has their first encounter with a large contingent of the Brotherhood of Steel along with one of the leaders of the Brotherhood of Steel, Sarah Lyons. A large push occurs to reach the radio station, fighting through waves of Super Mutants, eventually resulting in an encounter with a Behemoth. Following their entry to the radio station, the player is introduced to the man that runs Galaxy News Radio, Three Dog. In return for information Three Dog has about James, the player must travel to the Museum of Technology within the DC ruins, in search of a new relay dish capable of broadcasting Galaxy News Radio across the Capital Wasteland. After mounting this new dish on the Washington Monument, the player returns to Three Dog, who recalls that James had come to ask about Rivet City, a settlement built in an old aircraft carrier. The Lone Wanderer sets off again, follows in James' footsteps.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2513396\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2513396\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7395/2513396-2013-06-14_00007.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the game's more surreal interludes</figcaption></figure><p>After a thorough security check to gain entry to Rivet City, the Wanderer is referred to an old acquaintance of James, one Dr. Li, who reveals exactly what their father's goals were. The player learns that their father left the Vault in order to complete a project from before the Lone Wanderer was born, a water purifier that would supply clean water for all living things, called Project Purity. She tells the Lone Wanderer of the former lab that housed Project Purity and that their father might have gone there. The Lone Wanderer visits the Jefferson Memorial and finds out through a series of audio notes that their father went to Vault 112 in search of a G.E.C.K., which was the last component needed to cause Project Purity to complete it's function. The Wanderer themselves then travels to Vault 112, where they are greeted by a Robobrain ushering them into a stasis chamber, only to discover that the residents, along with James, are all trapped within these chambers. All of the residents existed within a simulation, with Stanislaus Braun, disguised as a young girl, pulling the strings. The player is forced to either end the simulation, killing everyone inside, or comply with Braun's twisted desires and go on a murder spree. Following this, when the player is allowed to leave the simulation, they learn that James was trapped inside the simulation as well, disguised as a dog, watching all of the player's actions. Regardless of choice, the Wanderer and James escape Vault 112 and make their way back to Rivet City. James convinces Dr. Li to accompany the Wanderer and him, along with her team back to the Jefferson Memorial to restart Project Purity. Once inside, the entire team beings work to restore Project Purity to it's former glory, and the Wanderer and James enjoy their short reunion. Unfortunately, shortly after the team begins their repair, the Enclave comes to the Jefferson Memorial and tries to take over the project for their own purposes. During the confrontation, James and Colonel Autumn are locked inside the main chamber in a standoff for control. Eventually, James sacrifices himself and kills several Enclave soldiers (including, apparently, Col. Autumn) by flooding the testing chamber with lethal amounts of radiation.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958675\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958675\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3715/958675-fallout_3_broken_steel_pc_002.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Enclave troops are just bad news for everyone</figcaption></figure><p>After the sacrifice, the Lone Wanderer escapes the lab with Dr. Li and some of hear team through some underground tunnels and eventually ends up in the Citadel, the East Coast headquarters of the Brotherhood of Steel. After recovering and a short respite, Dr. Li pleads Elder Lyons to aid the Wanderer to finish Project Purity by finding a G.E.C.K. and take Project Purity back from the Enclave. Following a discussion with Scribe Rothchild, the player learns that they must travel through the Little Lamplight Caverns to reach Vault 87, which is believed to contain a G.E.C.K. The Lone Wanderer eventually reaches Little Lamplight, but is stopped by Mayor MacCready, who will only allow entry to the player, (barring excellent speech skill or the Child at Heart Perk) if they can rescue some children who were captured by slavers. Following the breakout from Paradise Falls, the Wanderer gains entry to Little Lamplight and eventually enters Vault 87. It is here that they learn that Vault 87 was used to create and test the F.E.V. (Forced Evolutionary Virus) and is the breeding source of the Super Mutants in Washington DC. Following the discovery and aid in extradition of Fawkes, the Lone Wanderer acquires the G.E.C.K. After parting ways with Fawkes while leaving the vault, the Lone Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave, who knock him out and bring them to their headquarters in Raven Rock, commandeering the G.E.C.K. for themselves.</p><p>Awakening in their cell in Raven Rock, the Lone Wanderer is briefly interrogated by the revived Colonel Autumn, before being interrupted by President John Henry Eden, who allows the Lone Wanderer access to his control room. As the Lone Wanderer makes their way to the control room, Colonel Autumn goes against President Eden's orders and commands the Enclave soldiers to intercept the player. The Wanderer fights their way to the control room, and discovers that the President is actually a supercomputer who was given control of the United States. In the event of an end of the world scenario, President Eden was enacted to continue running the government sectors.The President and the Wanderer have a lengthy conversation, with Eden eventually imploring the player to feed a modified F.E.V. into Project Purity. This strain would kill anything with mutations that drinks from the purified water, allowing the Enclave to begin a new, mutation free society. Unfortunately, this would also kill most of the allies the Wanderer has encountered, weighing the decision heavily. If the Wanderer had the skill, (or the override code stolen from Col. Autumn) they can in fact destroy Raven Rock, crippling the Enclave forces immensely.</p><p>After the Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock, they are reunited with Fawkes, who aid in their return to the Citadel. The Brotherhood of Steel is preparing an all out assault on the Jefferson Memorial, planning to strike while the Enclave is off balance. Fortuitously, along to help the assault is Liberty Prime, who had regained function through the use of Dr. Li's research. Sarah Lyons invites the player to join Lyons' Pride, and the assault begins. With the aid of Liberty Prime in removing barriers, and the assault force of the Brotherhood, eventually the alliance is able to decimate the Enclave defenders which allows the Lone Wanderer to enter the control room. It is there the Wanderer and Lyons' Pride confront Colonel Autumn, who could be forced to stand down either through violence or persuasion. Following the confrontation, the player is then informed by Dr. Li through the intercom that Project Purity has been damaged in the attack will overload if someone doesn't activate it. Unfortunately, the chamber must be sealed with the start-up sequence begins, and the one who activates it will be bathed in lethal doses of radiation. Before entering the chamber, the player is faced with the choice of injecting the modified F.E.V. into Project Purity effectively killing everyone, or allowing mutants and wastelanders to continue to exist. The Lone Wanderer will then have the choice to activate Project Purity, tell Sarah Lyons she must activate it, or do nothing and allow it to be destroyed. The regular game ends on that decision and continues with a epilogue that varies based on the Lone Wanderer's karma throughout the game, along with the decisions they made throughout the main and side missions. The game would continue if the Broken Steel DLC pack was downloaded.</p><h2>Factions</h2><p>There are numerous factions present in the Capital Wasteland, both hostile and friendly.</p><p><a href=\"/brotherhood-of-steel/3015-1652\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1652\"><b>Brotherhood of Steel</b></a>- Situated in the ruins of the Pentagon (now called the Citadel), they are on the East</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1288/500275-bos_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-500275\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1288/500275-bos_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-500275\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1288/500275-bos_logo.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1288/500275-bos_logo.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Coast to battle the Super Mutant threat in the DC area.

In the simulation, the player experiences the beginning of this operation, in which the first power armor units were used and U.S. forces ultimately drove out the Chinese presence. In the virtual simulation the player will first have to secure a mountainside and then fight his/her way into a Chinese base.</p><p>The add-on mainly focuses on the combat/stealth paths and gives the player new tools to use. The new tools include interactive Strike Teams that are placed under the player's command. The mission takes about four to five hours for the player to complete. The add-on also contains new weapons, armor and achievements and a new perk called \"Covert Ops.\" The new weapons and armor include top-secret technology used by both sides during the war, some of which the player can then use throughout the main game. The player is able to access the simulation via a new quest and map marker. It is accessible at any level, as soon as the player has left Vault 101.</p><p>Operation: Anchorage was released on January 26, 2009 at a cost of 800 Points ($9.99) on the <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Marketplace</a>.

The most noticeable effect the attacks had on Point Lookout were on its citizens, who are best described as fairly disfigured hillbillies.... although it is heavily implied, if not openly stated, that instead of being mutated by radiation, these particular miscreants are just inbred.

However, Black Isle Studios was suddenly closed down when their owner, Interplay Entertainment, went bankrupt. Bethesda first announced it had acquired the rights to the Fallout series from Interplay in 2004, although no information about Fallout 3 was released until 2007, when a teaser video and concept art were released. Bethesda purchased the license from struggling Interplay for just over $1 million and considered an upfront payment on future royalties. Bethesda only got the rights to make single-player Fallout games, while Interplay retained the rights to develop a Fallout MMO. Reactions to the acquisition in the gaming community were generally positive. Bethesda, having achieved critical and financial success with Morrowind, and nearing the final stretch of development for the much hyped Oblivion, had become a well-respected developer in the RPG genre, establishing a considerable pedigree. Controversy among Fallout fans abounded, however, when it became apparent that Fallout 3 was going to move away from its traditional top-down, isometric view from the original games.</p><h3>Van Buren</h3><p>Van Buren was the codename for <a href=\"/black-isle-studios/3010-99\" data-ref-id=\"3010-99\">Black Isle</a>\u2019s version of Fallout 3. It was canceled in 2003 when <a href=\"/black-isle-studios/3010-99\" data-ref-id=\"3010-99\">Black Isle</a> went out of business, although the game itself was nearing completion. It would have had a multiplayer mode and a combat system where the player could wield two weapons. A tech demo was created, but Bethesda will not be releasing it to the general public.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/361452-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-361452\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14220/361452-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-361452\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/361452-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14220/361452-1.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Inventory in the Van Buren Tech Demo</figcaption></figure><p>The story took place around the year 2250 and unfolded across Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada. The player was going to find him or herself in prison for crimes that they were either innocent or guilty of. One day they\u2019d wake up in a different cell than they had gone to sleep in. Then an attack on the prison would rupture the walls and give the player (and many others) a chance to escape into the Wasteland. Once free, the player would be besieged by robots and questions.</p><p>The villain was a man called Presper. He was a mad scientist who planned on using remaining nuclear weapons to totally obliterate all the life on the planet, as he deemed it unworthy. The attack on the prison was one step in that plan. The prisoners were all marked as contaminated with a virus similar to FEV called Limit 115. When a large majority of prisoners were returned to the Quarantine Zone (otherwise known as the prison) a Super AI called Ulysses that controlled it would scan and purge the world's contaminated zones to prevent further contagion. The problem was that so much of the world was tainted it would result in a new and more devastating nuclear strike than what had come before. Presper was counting on this and those he deemed Pure would survive on in his Boulder Dome until a time he decided the Earth was safe for resettlement. At that point they\u2019d ascend to the surface and start again. The player's mission was to uncover his plot and stop it. Ultimately, though, the player would at least partially fail. In the critical moments some nukes would launch and it was up to the player to decide exactly what got hit and what didn't.</p><p>In the Fallout continuity, all the events of Van Buren are considered non-canon.</p><h2>Rating Controversy</h2><p>On July 4, 2008, Fallout 3 was refused classification by the OFLC in Australia, thus making the game illegal for sale in the country. In order for the game to be reclassified, the offending content in the Australian version of the game would have to be removed by Bethesda Softworks and the game resubmitted to the OFLC. According the OFLC board report, the game was refused classification due to the \"realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method (bringing) the 'science-fiction' drugs in line with 'real-world' drugs. However, just a month later, Australian retailer Gamechip started taking pre-orders for a drug-free version of the game. It now looks like the</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190914\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.56333333333333\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190914\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4057/190914-fallout_3_4.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>And with all the heads exploding, you can see why.</figcaption></figure><p>game has been modified for release instead of outright banned though nothing is official. Australia is no stranger to banning games, in 2008 <a href=\"/dark-sector/3030-20497\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20497\">Dark Sector</a>, <a href=\"/shellshock-2-blood-trails/3030-23254\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23254\">Shellshock 2: Blood Trials</a> and Fallout 3 were banned. In August of 2008, however, the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) granted a rating of MA15 after changes were made to in-game drug references, particularly the renaming of morphine to \" <a href=\"/med-x/3055-1942\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1942\">Med-X</a>.\" In their report on the revised edition of the game, the OFLC found that \"The drug references within this revised version are justified by context and lend a strong playing impact to the game.\" The report also notes that drugs in the game are now \"depicted as stylized icons on a menu with the drug use itself not depicted.\"</p><h3>Original ruling</h3><p>The original ruling by the OFLC's stated that \"the game contains the option to take a variety of drugs known as \"chems\" using a device which is connected to the character's arm. These \"chems\" have positive and some negative effects (lowering of intelligence, or the character may become addicted to the chem). The positive effects include increase in strength, stamina, resistance to damage, agility, and hit points. Corresponding with the list of various \"chems\" are small visual representations of the drugs; these include syringes, tablets, pill bottles, a crack-type pipe, and blister packs. In the Board's view, these realistic visual representation of drugs and their delivery method bring the 'science-fiction' drugs in line with 'real-world' drugs. The player can also select and use Morphine (a prescribed drug) which has the positive effect of enabling the character to ignore limb pain when the character's extremities are targeted by the enemy.\"</p><h2>Further Controversy</h2><h3>Japan</h3><p>Some changes to the Japanese version of Fallout 3. The biggest change involves the elimination of the \"Power of the Atom\" side-quest, about a nuclear bomb in the middle of a town, with players having the option to detonate the device or not. Also removed is Mr. Burke, an NPC who invites the player to detonate the town. Another change relates to the name of a weapon. Although not mentioned in the announcement, it refers to the \"Fat Man\" mini-nuke launcher. Lesser changes involve the renaming of creatures, as well as a reduction in the amount of blood and corpses found in the game.</p><p>Another mini-controversy caused by the game appeared at Game Developers Conference in <a href=\"/san-francisco/3035-191\" data-ref-id=\"3035-191\">San Francisco</a>, where the game's developer <a href=\"/emil-pagliarulo/3040-74863\" data-ref-id=\"3040-74863\">Emil Pagliarulo</a> asked the audience what landmarks in Japan could be destroyed for the game.</p><h3>India</h3><p>Microsoft India canceled its plans to release Fallout 3 for the Xbox 360 in India, which was earlier set to release in the country on October 28 2008. A press statement issued by Microsoft states that the game included certain content that could potentially hurt Indian sensibilities. Due to distribution issues in the region, Microsoft had taken up the role of distributor for Fallout 3 in India, while the PlayStation 3 and PC versions of the game were never scheduled for release in the country.</p><h2>Pop Culture References</h2><ul><li>The quest titled \"THOSE!\" is reference to the 1950's Sci-Fi film THEM! about giant ants.</li><li>The quest \"Replicated Man\" is very similar to film Blade Runner in which Harrison Ford's character may or may not be Android hunting down other Androids.</li><li>The character <a href=\"/bryan-wilks/3005-8556\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8556\">Bryan Wilks</a> during the quest \"Those\" utters the line \"Now I know what a TV dinner feels like\".

There are a total of 70 Perks, each with its own mini ranking system, totaling 275 ranks.</p><p>Perks are no longer tied to the player\u2019s character level or relative Skill level. The 70 Perks are divided into groups of 10 under each of the 7 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. Each Perk requires a different value of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat that it is tied to, from 1 to 10. For each point in a stat, the same number of perks in that stat\u2019s group is available to the player.</p><p>Each time the character levels up, the player can add an additional Perk, upgrade an already acquired Perk, or forgo Perks and instead add a level to one of their S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats.</p><h4><strong>Strength Perks</strong></h4><table data-max-width=\"false\"><thead><tr><th

The game has a hand-drawn cartoon art style very similar to <a href=\"/shank/3025-2154\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2154\"> Shank</a>. It allows players to approach each level how they see fit, with most situations allowing for multiple ways to solve them. Each level contains numerous hidden items &amp; challenge rooms, which act as currency towards unlocking new equipment and skills.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>A nameless ninja of the Hisomu Clan is awakened by a fellow female companion, as an emergency bell is ringing. They learn that the clan village is under attack by an organization called Hessian Services, who have sent a mercenary team headed by Corporal Kelly. Shortly after being rescued, Azai, the ninja leader, reveals that the attack on the village was orchestrated by Count Karajan, who runs Hessian Services and is seeking to retrieve a stolen item from the Hisomu Clan. Azai then reveals the player to be the current Champion of the Hisomu clan.</p><p>The Champion is a member of the Hisomu clan that is tattooed using a magical ink. It was discovered before \"the Restoration,\" an event that restored the clan although few specifics are given, by a merchant who informed the Hisomu about a rare plant that contains a special ink that is said to give the user great power, at the cost of his sanity. The Champion, therefore, must always be a student, so that his teacher can control him should he descend into insanity, and is expected to sacrifice his own life before the madness sets in, in order to protect the clan and it is secret. The act of creating a Champion is both a great honour to the recipient, but it is also a final option.</p><p>Azai then declares to take the attack to Hessian Services in order to protect the Hisomu clan, using the current Champion as their weapon. Through conversations with his companion, it is learned that privately, among his fellow ninja, Champions are referred to as \"the Severed\". When carrying the mark of a Champion, he is to be treated as an outcast and be banished until his mission is finished and then expected to die for the clan.</p><p>After Count Karajan is assassinated, the Champion returns to his village to find that Azai has been using him to acquire the weapons and armour from Hessian Services. Before the Champion could commit suicide, spurred on by the comments of his companion, he decides to take revenge on Azai and disappears to regroup with his ally. Searching for the reasons for Azai's betrayal, the Champion discovers that Dosan, the clan's tattooist, has preceded him to the middle east, and been captured by bandits.</p><p>When the ninja catches up with him, Dosan gives him the final part of the tattoo, the Mark of Serenity, which allows him to teleport, and reveals that the flowers whose petals are ground to create the magic ink for the tattoos have all died due to neglect. Optional scrolls that the player can collect reveal that Azai decided to steal the modern equipment from Karajan after he learned of the loss of the flowers, fearing that without the ability to create more Champions, the clan was doomed. The Champion and his companion escape, but Dosan is killed by Azai's \"Stalkers\", women trained in the ways of the ninja, but using modern technology like motion sensing rigs, night vision goggles, and even laser weapons.</p><p>Escaping the Stalkers and returning to the clan's village, the Champion finds himself rapidly descending into madness; grinning demon faces float in the air and watch him, and armed soldiers like the guards he faced whilst getting to Karajan appear to patrol the village - only to turn into his fellow ninja once they are killed. The Champion makes his way through the village and is faced with a series of sealed doors when he attempts to get into Azai's garden. He unlocks the doors by recreating the final test he went through as a student to become a full-fledged ninja, and then escapes from a group of Stalkers who burst into the room afterwards.</p><p>When the Champion finally confronts Azai, it is revealed that his companion doesn't really exist; she was merely a hallucination, the first symptom of the madness brought on by the tattoo. As Azai implores him to take his own life and regain his honour, the figment tells the Champion \"I never lied to you\", and says that Azai still needs to be punished for his betrayal and deception. The Champion then walks, unimpeded, to the heart of the Hisomu Clan stronghold, where he retrieves a sacred sword, and experiences an incredibly vivid hallucination reminding him of all that has happened since he got the mark. At the end, he has another moment of lucidity, and is confronted by both his imaginary friend and Azai, who kneel passively on opposite sides of a courtyard. The player must then choose their final target. If they attack the companion, the Champion whirls around and runs himself through with the sword so that the blade strikes her as well, dissipating her image, before he twists the blade, killing himself. Alternatively, the Champion stabs Azai, killing him, and then descends into complete insanity.</p><p>Regardless of which option the player chooses, the repercussions of their actions are not shown.</p><p> </p><h3>Combat</h3><p>Players start out the game with no weapons at all, and must learn sneaking and hiding techniques first. But within the first level, players are quickly awarded a sword, darts, and a grappling hook.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>The Sword of Tetsuji</b></td><td>A relic of the Hisomu clan's founder that has upheld their tradition for hundreds of years.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Darts</b></td><td>Basic bamboo darts, good for breaking fragile things and causing distractions. When using the bamboo darts, the player has the ability to tag multiple targets and attack all at once.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Grappling Hook</b></td><td>Allows the ninja to latch onto &amp; spider-dangle from grapple points.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>Quick Kills</b> - The player is able to execute quick kill techniques that require they follow an on screen button prompt, which are only available as long as they are not spotted.</p><p><b>Unarmed Combat</b> - It is the Hisomu way to only attack with a sword if only able to neutralize your enemy in one strike, so when the player attacks an enemy outside of a stealth kill, the ninja relies on kicks and punches. But when an enemy is knocked down using unarmed combat, the player may perform a quick kill while they are incapacitated on the ground. If they knock down and finish off the enemy fast enough, the Champion can kill his opponent before an alarm is raised.</p><h3>Sneaking</h3><p>The ninja is silent while walking, only making noise if the player chooses to run. The ninja also has the ability to hide his enemies bodies as to not alarm the other sentries. Items can be used to create a sound effects within the enemies noise bubble as to distract them while the ninja continues to traverse. Another item that can be used to climb great heights is a grappling hook, allowing the ninja to reach darkened areas that can be used as an escape from the enemies sight. Darts can be used to destroy lamps or emit sound off gongs thus giving a larger range of darkness to hide in or to distract an enemy. Later in the game, they are also granted the Farsight ability, which is a type of x-ray ability that allows the ninja to view all enemies and connections between objects and their functions.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p>As players progress through the game, they will gain points that can be used to unlock additional items and abilities. These \"loadouts\" allow the player to approach the game how they see fit, whether it be pure stealth, or in a more offensive attacking way.</p><h3>Techniques</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Hangman's Hymn</b></td><td>Allows the player to kill an unsuspecting enemy while dangling from a grapple point.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Emperors Abyss</b></td><td>Allows the player to kill an enemy while standing or hanging directly below him.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Twilight Gate</b></td><td>Allows the player to kill an enemy through a door.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Bat's Prey</b></td><td>Allows the player to kill an enemy from above.</td></tr><tr><td><b>A Brief Shadow</b></td><td>Allows the player to kill an enemy from a hiding spot.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Bloody Whisper</b></td><td>Allows the player to quickly kill a disabled enemy.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Rising Snake</b></td><td>Allows the player to launch an enemy into the air.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Slide Kick</b></td><td>Allows the player to slide kick, knocking an enemy off their feet.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Superior Lockpicks</b></td><td>Allows the player to unlock locked doors much more quickly.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Grim Harbringer</b></td><td>Allows the player to hang the body of a dead enemy on a perch point.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Softened Cloth Tabi</b></td><td>Reduces noise made while running.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Parachute Cloth</b></td><td>Slows the descent while falling or jumping.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Armored Sleeves</b></td><td>Grants extra protection without compromising agility</td></tr><tr><td><b>Reinforced Cloth</b></td><td>Armored clothing will provide greater protection without sacrificing mobility or speed.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Distraction Items</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Noise Maker</b></td><td>A small firecracker that will get the attention of any enemy near by.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Noise Maker</b><br /><b>Upgrade</b></td><td>A custom fuse allows the noise makers to be detonated remotely.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Smoke Bomb</b></td><td>Emits a smoke field that has the ability to block laser trip wires and breaks the line of sight of near by enemies.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Smoke Bomb Upgrade</b></td><td>A choking powder has been added to the smoke cloud, disabling enemies within it, unless they are wearing gas masks.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Distraction Flare</b></td><td>An alchemical light that draws the attention of nearby guards facing the flare and blinds enemies that are wearing night vision goggles.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Distraction Flare Upgrade</b></td><td>A custom fuse allows the flares to be detonated remotely.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cardboard Box</b></td><td>Allows the ninja access to a cardboard box to hide in at any time.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Carboard Box Upgrade</b></td><td>Allows the ninja to perform a stealth kill while hiding in the box.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Attack Items</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Spike Mine</b></td><td>A throwable mine that kills the first enemy to walk over it.

At the outset, Cadence has her heart stolen by the NecroDancer and must battle the hordes of monsters under his control in order to retrieve it.</p><p>The player must time their movements and attacks to the beat of the game's soundtrack. The game makes use of only four keys to control the character (for up, down, left and right). Combinations of movement keys are used for the player's inventory of usable items and spells. A dance pad may be used as well, with a specific game mode tailored to train with it. The more the player moves perfectly to the beat without taking damage, the higher the score multiplier will be.</p><h2>Modes</h2><p>Crypt of the NecroDancer features several game modes:</p><h4>Normal Mode</h4><p>Playing the game one zone at a time. When a zone is beaten, the player is returned to the lobby with the next one is unlocked. Players can earn diamonds in this mode, which can be used to unlock items, upgrades, and manipulate which items appear in the next normal mode run.</p><h4>Local Co-op</h4><p>A second player can play alongside the first in this mode. Every player gets their own inventory, but gold is shared. Everyone moves to the same beat.</p><h4>All Zones Mode</h4><p>Also known as Hardcore Mode. Every item is unlocked, and every character always starts with a specific number of hearts and equipment. Everyone starts from the Zone 1 Level 1, and progresses through all zones through the final boss. A speedrun timer and a low-percent run indicator is also available in this mode (low percent means not picking up any items in the game.) A seeded run option to have a consistent dungeon layout is also available.</p><h4>Daily Challenge Mode</h4><p>Similar to the All Zones Mode, but everyone gets the same seed for the day and only one chance to get on the leaderboards.</p><h4>Story Mode</h4><p>Play through all zones with Cadence, Melody, and Aria one after the other.</p><h4>All Characters Mode</h4><p>Play through the game with all characters (except Coda) in succession. Unlocked after unlocking all characters except Coda.</p><h4>Deathless Mode</h4><p>All Zones Mode, but loops around at the end. This mode only ends when the player is defeated.</p><h4>Dance Pad Mode</h4><p>Designed for players to practice using dance pads with. Easier than the usual, as everything is unlocked, less enemies are spawned, and the player starts with better equipment.</p><h4>Level Editor</h4><p>Create your own levels and share them with others. Unlocked after beating Zone 4.</p><p><strong>Codex</strong></p><p>Puzzle rooms created with the intent of teaching players some advanced strategies. The Bard character is always selected in the Codex rooms.</p><ol><li>Dragon Lore: teaches players how to avoid a Red Dragon's fireballs and defeat it with the Red Dragon Dance</li><li>Trap Lore: teaches players strategies for navigating traps.</li><li>Bomb Lore: teaches players strategies for using bombs.</li><li>How To Get Away With Murder: teaches players strategies for defeating shopkeepers.</li></ol><h2>Music</h2><p>The original soundtrack is composed and produced by <a href=\"/danny-baranowsky/3040-99995\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99995\">Danny Baranowsky</a>. An EDM remix soundtrack by A_Rival and a metal remix soundtrack by FamilyJules7x replaces the original soundtrack when playing as Melody and Aria, respectively. Any of the three soundtrack mixes can also be selected for any character in the options menu. A custom music soundtrack can also be set to any levels (including bosses) at any time.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>There are multiple playable characters, each changes the way the player interacts with the game, what items may be accessible, and the starting gear for All Zones mode.</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Character</th><th scope=\"col\">General Information</th><th scope=\"col\">Items</th><th scope=\"col\">All Zones mode</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cadence</td><td>The main hero.

Each zone contains three levels and a boss fight. Every level is <a href=\"/procedural-generation/3015-328\" data-ref-id=\"3015-328\">procedurally generated</a>. Every proceeding level in a given zone has a faster tempo than the last, but the first level's tempo is not faster than the previous zone's last level. The boss fight for every zone (except the last) is randomly picked.</p><p>When the song for a level ends without the player reaching the stairs to the next level, a trap door will appear and send them immediately to the next level. This trap door behaves similarly to the stairs, specifically in that it does not lock you in a room filled with monsters like normal trap doors do. The stairs for each level are locked until the player defeats the mini-boss for the level.</p><table data-max-width=\"false\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Zone No.</th><th scope=\"col\">Theme</th><th scope=\"col\">Description</th><th scope=\"col\">Monsters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Cave</td><td>The beginner zone. Consists of small rooms connected by narrow passageway. Has water tiles, which takes one extra step to cover up with dirt before getting out.</td><td>Slimes, bats, ghosts, skeletons</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Jungle</td><td>Has bigger passageways and less doors than the first zone. Has tar tiles, which always takes two steps to get out of.</td><td>Armadillos, golems, mushrooms, armored skeleton and skeleton mages</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fire &amp; Ice</td><td>Every level is separated into a fire section and an ice section. Consists of big, open rooms and cauldrons that spill hot coals or ice. Hot coal tiles damages the player when they don't move for one beat, and ice tiles causes the player to slide (attempting to move while sliding counts as a miss.)</td><td>Elementals, hellhounds, goblins, Yetis, skeleton knights</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Dungeon</td><td>Consists of rectangular rooms separated by walls. Digging a wall tile will dig wall tiles adjacent to it. Has green ooze tiles, which turns the player small and cannot attack enemies when they are on it.</td><td>Blademasters, liches, warlocks, harpies, spiders</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Minibosses</h2><p>Minibosses are spawned at the end of every level. They have to be defeated before the player can access the stairs to the next level. Most minibosses have different types of varying difficulty, which appear in different levels of the zone.</p><h4>Dragons</h4><p>The most iconic of fantasy creatures. Dragons move every other beat, pursuing and digging their way to the player. There are three types of dragons: green, red, and blue. Green Dragons only have melee attacks. Red Dragons charge a fireball when the player is directly on a horizontal line, and fire it on the next beat. Blue Dragons have a conic ice breath instead of a fireball, which freezes the players for 4 beats.</p><p>Red Dragons may prove tricky to defeat for beginners, as they spawn from 1-2 onwards. There is a well-known strategy to defeat Red Dragons, colloquially known as the Red Dragon Dance. To do the Red Dragon Dance, get in a position where the player is directly in front of a Red Dragon before it charges a fireball. The player can then attack the dragon, step to a side to dodge its fireball, step right next to the dragon (above or under), and step back. The player will be in the start position of the dance, but one tile over. Repeat until the dragon is defeated. When done perfectly, the dragon can be defeated within a 2x2 square.</p><h4>Minotaurs</h4><p>Minotaurs move on every beat, trying to pursue the player. When spotting a player in a cardinal direction, they will start charging in a straight line in that direction. When it hits a wall or an obstacle (e.g. the player), it will be stunned for two beats. Gray minotaurs have more health than the normal ones.</p><h4>Direbats</h4><p>Direbats move on every other beat in a random cardinal direction. Grey direbats have more health than the yellow ones.</p><h4>Banshees</h4><p>Banshees move on every beat towards the player, and can move diagonally. They will deafen the player of the soundtrack and get knocked back when hit. The deaf effect is nullified when they are defeated. The player has to be careful not to move right towards the Banshee after hitting, because they can still attack the player. Green banshees have more health than the blue ones. Starts appearing from Zone 2.</p><h4>Nightmares</h4><p>Nightmares move on every other beat towards the player, darkening the area surrounding it. Red nightmares have more health than black Nightmares. Starts appearing from Zone 2.</p><h4>Ogres</h4><p>Moves every four beats towards the player. It carries a large club that can reach three tiles. When the player is in range, it will raise its club to attack as its next move. The powerful club attack also damages other monsters and containers. Appears in Zone 4.</p><h4>The Mommy</h4><p>A dancing mummy mommy. Moves every four beats towards the player. Sometimes summons a breakdancing baby mummy instead of moving. The baby mummy moves towards the player every other beat. Appears in Zone 4.</p><h2>Bosses</h2><p>There is a random boss encounter at the end of every zone. Each boss functions in a different way, each having its own game mechanic associated to it. Each boss also has a legion of other enemies alongside that may stand in the player's way. Once the boss is defeated, all other enemies disappear. When the player defeats a boss without missing, there is a flawless victory bonus where the player can choose to open one of three chests.</p><p>Each boss functions slightly differently and may have different minions in different zones. The deeper the zone is, the more health they will also have.</p><h4>King Conga</h4><p>The king of the undead conga line, he sits atop his throne in amusement. King Conga cannot normally be hit on his throne and will only fight the player once his conga lines of zombies is defeated. King Conga moves on every beat and can also move diagonally. He also has the ability to teleport away to a random space upon taking damage.</p><p>King Conga will also get off the throne to attack the player when the player misses a beat even when the conga lines have not been defeated, but he will teleport back to his throne without getting damaged when the player attacks him. Every eighth beat in the song is skipped in this level, so the player must not move every seven beats or it will count as a miss.</p><p>There are two conga lines of zombies that follows the yellow leader zombie. If a zombie is separated from the conga line, they will turn red in rage. The red zombies move on every beat, while the other zombies move on every other beat.</p><h4>Death Metal</h4><p>A reaper of death that holds a scythe, a shield, and dances to a fast-paced metal song. Death Metal will chase after the player every three beats. He holds his shield in front of him, and it blocks non-phasing damage. Every time Death Metal blocks, bats will be summoned. Attacking him from other sides will eventually make him drop his shield.</p><p>After dropping his shield, he will occasionally shout a phrase that telegraphs his move. The move depends on how much health he has left. At high health (\"Come to me!\"), he will summon more minions after 4 beats. At lower health (\"End of the line!\"), he will summon stronger minions instead. At critical health (\"Bathe in fire!\"), he will instead shoot fireballs. He will also move on every beat at this last phase.</p><h4>Deep Blues</h4><p>A king with an entire army of chess pieces. Every piece behaves similarly to their corresponding chess piece at a consistent beat pattern, telegraphing one beat before moving. Like in chess, the pawns will also turn into queens when reaching the other end of the stage.</p><p>The king has more health than the other pieces and will run away from the player, castling with a rook at first chance. When attacked, the king will teleport away. The king will only move to attack the player once all other chess pieces are defeated.</p><h4>Coral Riff</h4><p>An electric guitar-shaped octopus who wields numerous musical instruments with every one of its tentacles. Half of the stage is filled with water, and every tile any of its body parts moves into will also turn into water tiles. Its tentacles will first attack the player two or four at a time. They will first submerge, and then reemerge around the player. They will teleport back when hit, or when the player does not attack them. The corresponding instrument will stop playing the background music when they are submerged or defeated.</p><p>When all eight tentacles have attacked twice or defeated, the remaining tentacles and the main body will all move slowly towards the player. Defeated tentacles will appear on the surrounding walls to continue playing the background music. The main body moves every two beats, splashing water to all surrounding tiles, turning them into water tiles and possibly damaging the player.</p><h4>Dead Ringer</h4><p>Only Cadence will encounter this boss at the end of Zone 4. Dead Ringer is completely invincible to non-phasing damage. Four bells are initially placed on the stage, and Dead Ringer will try to hit them with his big hammer. The bells will summon a miniboss when hit by either Dead Ringer or the player. From the top-left corner clockwise, they respectively spawn a green dragon, an ogre, a Nightmare, and a Minotaur. Dead Ringer may spot the player in a cardinal direction and charge at the player like a Minotaur. If Dead Ringer crashes into a bell, the bell gets destroyed without summoning a miniboss.</p><p>When all four bells have been rung or destroyed, Dead Ringer will begin to glow. He moves faster and charges straight to the other end of the line in one beat in this state. To defeat him, he must charge straight onto the large gong that appears at the top end of the room. Once he rings the gong with his charge, the fight instantly ends.</p><h4>The Necrodancer</h4><p>After defeating Dead Ringer, Cadence meets Dorian and they both get transported into the Necrodancer's lair. The player controls both Cadence and Dorian in this level, with both characters moving to the same key presses at the same time. The Necrodancer and his minions are up on a stage, holding the Golden Lute hostage with evil magic. They are unreachable while atop the stage.</p><p>Trap tiles are spawned on the level two at a time, and the player must control both Cadence and Dorian to stand on both tiles at the same time. The walls and stage can be used to offset their positions and match the placements of the tiles. For every traps that get activated, the Necrodancer's stage gets bombed, progressively releasing his minions until the Golden Lute and the Necrodancer himself are blown off the stage. Cadence must then defeat the Necrodancer using the Golden Lute (with Dorian still controlled at the same time). The Golden Lute damages the Necrodancer and his minions surrounding Cadence as she moves around.</p><p>After defeating the Necrodancer as Cadence, the player has to fight him for the last time as Melody. The walls keep shrinking as the song gets closer to the end, crushing Melody at the very end. The song also slowly increases its tempo as it progresses.</p><p>The Necrodancer will initially try to avoid Melody, depending on his numerous minions and the ever-shrinking wall to defeat you. At his last heart, he will gain an impenetrable shield and summon many skeletons behind him. The top part of the level will also be transformed into lava. Melody must defeat the skeletons and push the Necrodancer into the lava to win the fight.</p><h2>Shops</h2><p>All shops sell items 3 at a time and accept a variety of currencies including gold, diamonds, and health. Gold is used as the score for the runs and is reset every run. Gold is dropped by monsters, and in some dungeon walls in All Zones Mode (visible by a shining glint). Diamonds are only found in non-All Zones modes on the dungeon floors and walls (replacing hidden gold). They must be spent in the lobby immediately after the run they are found for upgrades and item/spell unlocks.</p><h3>Dungeon Shops</h3><p>Many dungeon shops have golden walls, which can be destroyed by bomb or blood shovel to yield 10 gold coins per tile.</p><p>Most shopkeepers can also be murdered for an item drop and getting all the shop items for free. Keep in mind, however, that most shopkeepers are also very difficult to defeat. The final codex level (\"How To Get Away With Murder\") illustrates some strategies that could be used to defeat shopkeepers.</p><p>All shops other than the coin shop are only accessible through runes. They are hidden under wall tiles and must dug out to be used. Wall tiles that hide them have visible cracks.</p><p><strong>Coin Shop</strong> - The standard shop that sells items for gold. There is one on every floor and the walls are made of gold. Defeating a shopkeeper will leave all shops for the rest of the run abandoned, with items free for the taking.</p><p><strong>Grey Coin Shop </strong>- Looks like the standard shop, but the walls are slightly grey and the shopkeeper has red eyes. The shopkeeper is immediately hostile upon entering. Defeating this shopkeeper will not affect the normal coin shop.</p><p><strong>Glass Shop</strong> - A shop that sells glass weapons and armor for gold.</p><p><strong>Blood Shop</strong> - Any item can be sold here, but for the price of some of the hero's health.</p><p><strong>Health Shop </strong>- Sells food items and heart containers.</p><p><strong>Transmogrification</strong> - A chamber that accepts gold to replace current equipment with a random new piece.</p><p><strong>Shrine Shop </strong>- Allows you to choose one of three shrines to use. Dragons will appear when the player attempts to blow the shrines up.</p><p><strong>Pawnbroker </strong>- Buys items from the player for half price. The shopkeeper transforms the whole shop into tar tiles when turning hostile.</p><p><strong>Conjurer</strong> - The conjurer will summon a random item of a chosen category for gold.</p><p><strong>Bait Shop</strong> - The shop area contains three items seemingly free for the taking. Upon picking one up, a few monsters (including minibosses) will spawn and the exit will be locked until they are defeated.</p><p><strong>Secret Dungeon Master Shop</strong> - May sometimes appear beyond the top wall of some shops. The shop floor is visible when the player has a far enough vision range. The player has to destroy the top wall to enter this shop. This shop will sell one powerful item for a low price. The dungeon master is the shopkeeper, and the only one that cannot be attacked.</p><h3>Lobby Shops</h3><p>These are shops found in the \"main menu\" lobby. Some of them have to be rescued from their cages within the dungeon. The cages are unlocked with Golden or Glass Keys, which can be found in the level's coin shop or hidden within the walls.</p><p><strong>Dungeon Master</strong> - Sells permanent upgrades like heart containers, coin multipliers, and the amount of chests that appear in dungeons. Like all lobby shops he accepts diamonds as currency.</p><p><strong>Hephaestus</strong> - Sells accessibility to open weapons, armor, and food in chests. After buying an item it will always appear in the next dungeon.</p><p><strong>Merlin</strong> - Sells accessibility to spells, rings, and scrolls. After buying an item it will always appear in the next dungeon.</p><p><strong>Beastmaster</strong> - Allows access to practice against all enemies the player has fought in dungeons before.</p><p><strong>Bossmaster</strong> - Allows access to practice against the games boss fights in all of the incarnations.</p><p><strong>Weaponmaster </strong>- Allows a selection of weapons (excluding Jeweled Dagger, Flower, and Golden Lute) for training in the Beastmaster and Bossmaster rooms.</p><p><strong>Janitor</strong> - Removes items from the item pool for the next non-All Zones run in exchange for diamonds.</p><p><strong>Diamond Dealer </strong>- Sells items to carry into the next non-All Zones run.</p><p> </p>", "deck": "Enter the dungeons of dance and fight enemies to the beat of the music.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/1992/2530003-screen+shot+2013-08-15+at+4.57.52+pm.png", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2530003-screen+shot+2013-08-15+at+4.57.52+pm.png", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/1992/2530003-screen+shot+2013-08-15+at+4.57.52+pm.png", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2530003-screen+shot+2013-08-15+at+4.57.52+pm.png", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1992/2530003-screen+shot+2013-08-15+at+4.57.52+pm.png", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/1992/2530003-screen+shot+2013-08-15+at+4.57.52+pm.png", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1992/2530003-screen+shot+2013-08-15+at+4.57.52+pm.png"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/3030-43536/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-43536/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": "2015-04-23 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2013-08-15 13:59:56", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/", "abbreviation": "PSNV", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/", "id": 143, "name": "PlayStation Network (Vita)"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/", "abbreviation": "PS4", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/", "id": 146, "name": "PlayStation 4"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/", "abbreviation": "LIN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/", "id": 152, "name": "Linux"}], "id": 43536, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Crypt of the NecroDancer"}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Crypt of the NecroDancer"}

It is a sequel of the <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a> game named after the main character of the games, <a href=\"/shantae/3005-10421\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10421\">Shantae</a> the half-genie. This game is <a href=\"/wayforward-technologies/3010-2294\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2294\">WayForward</a>'s first release since <a href=\"/mighty-flip-champs/3030-25552\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25552\">Mighty Flip Champs</a>, which was also released for the DSi. Information from Nintendo Power reveals a new mermaid friend, and a pirate ship (presumably belonging to <a href=\"/risky-boots/3005-10422\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10422\">Risky Boots</a>) with legs.</p><p>The game is a culmination of work done since 2002, at which point work began on a Shantae Sequel for the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>. The game was used as a demo on many different platforms in the intervening 8 years, including <a href=\"/psp/3045-18\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a>, <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>, <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS</a> and GBA, until it was decided to be turned into a <a href=\"/dsiware/3045-106\" data-ref-id=\"3045-106\">DSiWare</a> release instead of a full-fledged video game. This game features many artifacts from that original sequel.</p><p>On September 9th, 2011 <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2011/09/09/wayforward-bringing-shantae-to-ios-with-shantae-riskys-revenge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">it was revealed</a> that the game was being ported to the iPhone and other iOS devices. To accommodate for the virtual D-Pad, the game has been tweaked to make it feel on par with the original DSi Ware release. This includes making platforms slightly longer, having chains sway closer to the player, and changes to enemy behavior.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a side-scrolling action-platformer taking many structural cues from <a href=\"/metroid/3025-3\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3\">Metroid</a>. The entire gameplay world is a relatively continuous space, with certain areas inaccessible to Shantae until she acquires the appropriate shape-shifting with which she can reach them. These abilities (described below in Forms) allow her to vault across wide horizontal expanses; ram through stone barriers; and swim underwater. There is one town in the game which acts as a <a href=\"/hub-world/3015-1855\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1855\">central hub</a> for the game, though it doesn't technically lie exactly in the \"center\" of the game world and it isn't disconnected from the other areas of the game.</p><p>At various points in the game, Shantae will be tasked with simple fetch quests that involve her finding an item in one area of the game world and bringing it to the appropriate recipient (not always the requester) in another. These serve to advance the story as well as unlock fortresses that house boss characters she must defeat.</p><h3>Combat and Handling</h3><p>Shantae is nimble and can walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl under low spaces, and <a href=\"/dash/3015-2290\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2290\">backwards-dash</a>. She can change her direction mid-jump. She can also swim, but initially she can't dive into the depths of the sea as she simply floats back up to the surface whenever she tries. Her primary attack involves her <a href=\"/hair-attack/3015-710\" data-ref-id=\"3015-710\">whipping foes with her long ponytail</a>. Shantae can only attack with this method to the left or right of her. In general, her primary attack does not knock back enemies that can sustain multiple hits, so Shantae is able to repeatedly hit them with rapid successive ponytail strikes. In addition to damaging enemies, Shantae can also destroy certain bricks and vases with her ponytail.</p><p>Shantae can also employ magic to attack with projectile and orbiting barriers. Each use of a projectile reduces her magic meter by a set amount. For orbiting barriers, the magic meter is continually drained based on how long the barrier is kept activated. Shantae also fires off a bubble as her primary attack when in mermaid form (see Forms below).</p><h3>Items and Currency</h3><p>Shantae purchases the aforementioned magic from the item shop in town, where she can also purchase curative items for her health and magic meter, as well as upgrades for her hair (to allow for faster whipping) and a map of the game world. Items are purchased with gems, dropped by defeated enemies and found in treasure chests and vases. Some require magic jams, which are a finite <a href=\"/pick-ups/3015-2619\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2619\">pickup</a> scattered across the game world.</p><h4>Items and Spells</h4><ul><li>Potions - These recover several hearts of Shantae's health. They are sold in the item shop for 10 gems, or 25 gems for a pack of three potions. Though these can be used whenever Shantae wishes, Shantae can also find potions that take instant effect by breaking vases or defeating enemies.</li><li>Magic Vial - These recover a set amount of Shantae's magic bar. They are sold in the item shops for 15 gems, or 40 gems for a pack of three vials. Though these can be used whenever Shantae wishes, Shantae can also find vials that take instant effect by breaking vases or defeating enemies.</li><li>Fire-based magic - Fire magic can be purchased in three levels from the shop: a fireball for 30 gems; Spitfire (a triple fireball) for 50 gems and a bottle of magic jam; and a Flamethrower (continuous stream) for 300 gems and 2 bottles of magic jam.</li><li>Puffs - Despite the name, the Storm puff (50 gems), the Crush puff (125 gems, 1 jam) and the Mega Puff (250 gems, 2 jams) are powerful magical attacks emitted by storm clouds that Shantae deploys. Once deployed in an area, the storm clouds hover around that space and throw out the attacks of their own volition.</li><li>Pike ball shields - The pike ball shields act as an orbiting barrier around Shantae, similar to the special attacks found in the <a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\">Mega Man</a> franchise (from <a href=\"/wood-man/3005-1185\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1185\">Wood Man</a> and <a href=\"/skull-man/3005-1383\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1383\">Skull Man</a>, to name two examples) or <a href=\"/ryu-hayabusa/3005-104\" data-ref-id=\"3005-104\">Ryu</a>'s Invincible Fire Wheel from <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos/3030-14416\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14416\">Ninja Gaiden</a>. Each increasing level adds one pike ball to the mix, for a total of three pike balls. (Pike ball: 50 gems; Super pike ball: 150 gems and 1 jam; Mega Pike ball: 300 gems and 2 jams)</li><li>Attract Magic - This draws dropped items from enemies to Shantae when she comes near them, without requiring her to come in direct contact with them in order to pick them up. It is an always-on upgrade and does not drain her magic meter. (100 gems, 1 jam)</li><li>Magic Fill - This spell gradually fills Shantae magic meter over time. This is always active once purchased. (150 gems, 1 jam)</li><li>Hair creams - The Silky Cream (200 gems, 3 jams) and Super Silky Cream (300 gems, 3 jams) increases the speed at which Shantae attacks with her ponytail, allowing her to land more hits on her enemies in a shorter amount of time.</li><li>Sequin Land Map - Displays a map of the entire gameworld, including a very rough layout of underground caverns.</li></ul><h3>Forms</h3><p>As a genie, Shantae is--naturally--a belly dancer. Throughout the game, she gains the ability to shapeshift into different animal forms depending on what belly dance she executes. Mechanically, on <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS</a> platforms this is achieved by holding down the X button and then releasing it after a certain amount of time. How long the player holds down the button before releasing it determines which dance move she stops on, which in turn determines which form she takes on.</p><ul><li>Monkey - The first form she finds, Shantae shifts into a tiny monkey when she ends the dance during her first move. As a monkey, Shantae can climb on walls as well as jump farther and higher than she can normally. Further into the game, Shantae acquires an upgrade to the monkey form that allows her to rocket across wide horizontal expanses. This allows her to reach areas that were previously blocked by large chasms. She cannot attack in this form.</li><li>Elephant - The second form she finds, Shantae shifts into a large elephant who can charge into and destroy large stone blocks. She can also demolish the stone golems that block her path from some of the later areas in the game.</li><li>Mermaid - The final form she finds, Shantae shifts into a mermaid capable of diving deep into the water, allowing her to access underwater areas. Further into the game, Shantae acquires an upgrade to the mermaid form that allows her to fire off a bubble that damages enemies and destroys certain underwater barriers. Without this upgrade, Shantae cannot attack in this form at all.</li></ul>", "deck": "Shantae was released on DSiWare on October 4, 2010, courtesy of WayForward.

So much so that even the game's graphics and music are that of an <a href=\"/apple-ii/3045-12\" data-ref-id=\"3045-12\">Apple II</a>, one of the platforms on which the original The Oregon Trail was released. In Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, the player takes upon an Oregon Trail-like adventure with three player created characters. Once the characters have been created, the player is to choose their trusty wagon (the game starts with only 1 wagon unlocked, but there is somewhere around 10 secret wagons that are unlocked just by playing the game). SAWA's first screen is the same each time the adventure begins, but the game's screens are randomized from there on, making the adventure different every time it is played.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/36270/2272751-space_addventure.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2272751\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56\" data-width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/36270/2272751-space_addventure.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2272751\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/36270/2272751-space_addventure.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Traveling through space in the wagon.</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When starting the adventure, the player is to choose the name and pick the appearance of the three characters on the journey. Once that has been done, there is a plethora of different wagons to pick from to make the adventure in. Finally, the player can experience the Super Amazing Wagon Adventure. Most of Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is played like a <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=11\">two-dimensional shooter</a> within the wagon, but there are screens in which one of the characters goes out on foot and the game then turns into a <a href=\"/games/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=31\">dual-joystick shooter</a>. This gives the game a good mix of the two genres.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In between each playable screen, a black screen with text upon it will be shown. This could tell the player that one of the characters has come down with a near-fatal flu which will take the characters health down to 1 heart (each character starts with 4 hearts and health pick-ups are randomly dropped). The screen could also just be telling the player about what the characters have come upon, like a river. These screens are where most of the comedic value of Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is. In one screen, the player can choose to ford a river or attempt to jump over said river. If the player chooses to ford the river, a black screen comes up with the text, \"They made the (probably wise) decision to ford the river\". Alternatively, if the player chooses to jump over the river, they could end up jumping so high, they end up in orbit above Earth.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The player is never unarmed in Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, either. The starting weapon is a pistol with unlimited ammo, but the player can find weapon pick-ups that are randomly dropped with varying amounts of ammunition. These weapon pick-ups include the expected shotguns, snipers and bazookas, but some are ridiculously awesome like ray-guns, magic wands and ninja stars. The enemies fought in Super Amazing Wagon Adventure equally varies from normal to ridiculous. In one screen, the player could be shooting at deer and turkeys to collect for trading with a fur trader later on (which the player may or may not encounter because of the randomness factor). Maybe a few screens later, though, the player will be fighting off a horde of giant spiders or horseback riding bandits or even may be in a heated battle with a ginormous octopus that shoots projectiles out of its five tentacles.</p><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>2.0 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory: </strong>1 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Shader Model 2.0</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 65 MB available space</li></ul>", "deck": "Super Amazing Wagon Adventure is a new take on the classic Oregon Trail adventure, instead putting players in control of the wagon in a side-scrolling (and dual-joystick) shooter.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/3/36270/2271566-sawa.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36270/2271566-sawa.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/3/36270/2271566-sawa.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/36270/2271566-sawa.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/3/36270/2271566-sawa.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/3/36270/2271566-sawa.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/3/36270/2271566-sawa.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-amazing-wagon-adventure/3030-39080/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-39080/", "number_of_user_reviews": 1, "original_release_date": null, "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2012-07-20 20:45:37", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-86/", "abbreviation": "XBGS", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-games-store/3045-86/", "id": 86, "name": "Xbox 360 Games Store"}, {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC"}], "id": 39080, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Super Amazing Wagon Adventure"}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Super Amazing Wagon Adventure"}

Monster Bash was re-created digitally as part of the Table Pack #3 DLC for <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-pinball-arcade/3030-36777\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36777\">The Pinball Arcade</a>.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p>The main goal in Monster Bash is to collect the musical instrument of all six monsters. To collect an instrument the player must complete one of the six modes.</p><h3>Creature Feature</h3><p>The goal of Creature Feature is to hit all of the main shots and shoot all the ramps and loops before the time runs out. The player has twenty seconds to complete each shot. Each shot that is made will reset the timer to twenty seconds again. If the player completes this mode, Creature From the Black Lagoon's saxophone will be awarded.</p><h3>Full Moon Fever</h3><p>In Full Moon Fever the goal is to shoot the ball through the two ramps four times each. If Full Moon Fever is completed, The Wolfman's drums will be awarded.</p><h3>Ball &amp; Chain</h3><p>To start Ball &amp; Chain the player must shoot each of the ramps three times. Once Ball &amp; Chain is started the goal is to then shoot each of the ramps three times each again. If Ball &amp; Chain is completed, The Bride of Frankenstein's microphone will be awarded.</p><h3>Frankenstein Multiball</h3><p>In Frankenstein Multiball the player must assemble Frankenstein. To assemble him the player must hit him a total of seven times. Once Frankenstein has been hit seven times he will rise up. Once he has risen the goal is to then hit him six more times. If Frankenstein Multiball is completed, Frankenstein's keyboard will be awarded.</p><h3>Mummy Mayhem</h3><p>Once started, the goal of Mummy Mayhem is to collect 7.5 million points in forty-five seconds. If the 7.5 million points have been collected, The Mummy's bass will be awarded.</p><h3>Drac Attack</h3><p>The goal of Drac Attack is to earn the letters to spell Dracula. The letters can be collected by hitting the Drac and Attack buttons. These Drac and Attack buttons must be hit a total of seven times (collectively). Once Dracula has been spelled out Dracula will emerge from his coffin. Once Dracula is out of the coffin the player must hit him five times. If Drac Attack has been completed, Dracula's guitar will be awarded.</p><h3><strong>Mosh Pit Multiball</strong></h3><p>This mode becomes lit after shooting the center spinner shot 6 times, and activated by hitting the scoop to the right of the spinner. In this mode, the major shots are lit for Jackpots, and the spinner acts as an Add-a-Ball to the multiball, with up to 4 balls in play starting from 2. The Frankenstein ramp is also lit as a Count-Up feature; 10 successful shots claims a Super Jackpot. The targets then come up, and they must be hit 5 times to claim a Super Jackpot. The cycle repeats after this.</p><h3><strong>Monster Bash</strong></h3><p>Activated by lighting all 6 Monsters in any order, followed by a scoop shot. This is a 4-ball multiball, with all monster shots lit for a fixed value. The spinner is also lit for a Bash Jackpot that increases and caps (typically at 7.5 million).</p><h3><strong>Monsters of Rock</strong></h3><p>Activated by lighting all 6 Instruments in any order, followed by a scoop shot. This is a 4-ball multiball, with all monsters lit for a fixed value. As an added feature, completing the 6 Monsters claims a special point bonus, starting at a 5X Multiplier and increasing up to 10X for each completion. The spinner shot spots any Monster shot that is not spotted of the 6.</p><h3><strong>Lyman's Lament</strong></h3><p>Hit the scoop 44 times during single-ball play to activate this mode, or enter a special code to access the mode without the bonuses and a cost of 1 credit. This mode normally awards 25 Bonus X and 2,500 added to the bonus for every switch. Regardless of the bonus, Lyman's Lament changes the main music that plays, and adds commentary of the programmer, Lyman Sheats, bashing you on how you play the game.</p>", "deck": "Monster Bash is a pinball machine that uses the Universal Studios monsters.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/10/103881/1780690-mb.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/103881/1780690-mb.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/10/103881/1780690-mb.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/103881/1780690-mb.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/10/103881/1780690-mb.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/10/103881/1780690-mb.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/103881/1780690-mb.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/monster-bash/3030-35168/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35168/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": "1998-07-31 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2011-05-11 15:19:05", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-83/", "abbreviation": "PIN", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pinball/3045-83/", "id": 83, "name": "Pinball"}], "id": 35168, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Monster Bash"}, "platform": "PC", "title": "Monster Bash"}

href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> game developed by <a href=\"/flagship-co-ltd/3010-1271\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1271\">Flagship Co., Ltd.</a> (with assistance from <a href=\"/dimps-corporation/3010-119\" data-ref-id=\"3010-119\">Dimps Corporation</a>) and published by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>. It is the second Kirby title for the GBA and is somewhat inspired by Flagship's work on the Four Swords game included with the GBA port of <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/3030-10276\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10276\">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a>. However while Fours Swords keeps players working closely together, in The Amazing Mirror player are free to separate and conquer challenges independently. Playing without human partners results in the game AI controlling the three other Kirbys, which creates a markedly different experience. Regardless of the number of players engaged, the maze-like Mirror World holds a challenge unique to the series. Flagship would later revisit the Kirby series with <a href=\"/kirby-squeak-squad/3030-1239\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1239\">Kirby: Squeak Squad</a> on the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> .</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror is unique from the rest of the series, in the way that it is structured in a way similar to <a href=\"/metroid/3025-3\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3\">Metroid</a> where the entire game is a large explorable area in which new areas and warps can be established.</p><p>There is a variety of extras hidden in chests such as maps, sound test tracks, different colors for Kirby, and additional health pieces. These chests are well hidden behind puzzles that require certain abilities. The Master Sword can be used to bypass any puzzle in the game. However, the sword is only accessible after defeating the game's final boss.</p><p>There is a total of nine areas in the game, each containing a boss who holds a piece of the mirror. When all nine mirror pieces are collected, the mirror will be completed and the final boss can be faced.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><h4>Regular enemies</h4><ul><li>Bang-Bang: Flies towards Kirby with little control, explodes upon impact.</li><li>Batty: Hangs from a surface and gives chase upon seeing Kirby.</li><li>Big Waddle Dee: A bigger version of Waddle Dee.</li><li>Blipper: A fish that can swim in the water, but flops around if it gets to land.</li><li>Blockin: Disguises himself as a star block and attacks if inhaled.</li><li>Bomber: Explodes killing all enemies on screen, but only if colliding with a surface or Kirby.</li><li>Boxin: Tries to punch Kirby while jumping back and forth.</li><li><a href=\"/bronto-burt/3015-3426\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3426\">Bronto Burt</a>: Flies towards Kirby in a zigzag pattern.</li><li>Chip: Hops around an a usually predetermined path.</li><li>Cookin: Throws a frying pan at Kirby, if it hits, Kirby is flipped and cooked on a frying pan.</li><li>Cupie: Flies through walls and shoots arrows at Kirby.</li><li>Droppy: Inhales Kirby and steals his ability, turning into whatever enemy Kirby inhaled to get said ability.</li><li>Flamer: Runs along walls until it notices Kirby, it will then break off the wall and fly towards Kirby.</li><li>Foley: Stays in a fixed position in the air, if Kirby gets too close, it will fall to the ground and explode upon impact.</li><li>Giant Rocky: A bigger version of Rocky.</li><li>Glunk: Stays underwater and fires at Kirby.</li><li>Golem: Attempts to attack Kirby, gives different abilities depending on its color, and whether it is rolling, punching, or doing nothing.</li><li><a href=\"/gordo/3015-4373\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4373\">Gordo</a>: Follows a predetermined path and cannot be killed.</li><li>Haley: Flies through the sky but will not change path if Kirby is spotted.</li><li>Heavy Knight: A bigger version of Sword Knight.</li><li>Hot Head: Tries to breathe fire on Kirby.</li><li>Jack: Stays in cannons, making them unusable, it can be blasted out of a cannon if the fuse is lit though.</li><li>Laser Ball: Can float through walls and shoot lasers at Kirby.</li><li>Leap: Flies through the air and kisses Kirby, making him unable to move as he wipes it off.</li><li>Metal Guardian: Stays in armor until Kirby gets close, will then fire lasers at Kirby.</li><li>Minny: A very small enemy that just moves around.</li><li>Mirra: Attaches to a Mirror Door and will burrow into the ground if it spots Kirby, taking the Mirror Door with it.</li><li>Noddy: Takes a few steps and then lies down.</li><li>Parasol Shotzo: A Shotzo that flies through the air with its attached Parasol.</li><li>Pengi: Blasts cold air at Kirby to freeze him.</li><li>Prank: Will attempt to throw projectiles at Kirby, or paint his face, both of which do damage.

The game is notable for its simplistic control scheme that only uses the analog stick for direction and one button on the Gamecube controller for decelerating and using power ups. Unlike most other driving games, acceleration occurs regardless of player input. The game is primarily intended to be played with multiple people, as there are no dedicated career mode</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><h3>Air Ride</h3><p>Race to the Finish on one of several courses. You can utilize boost pads, triggers, copy abilities and more to gain an advantage. Free Run mode also acts as a Time Trial mode that allows to set records.</p><h3>Top Ride</h3><p>This mode plays the most differently compared to the other two which the various tracks only fill a single screen (reminiscent of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32988\" href=\"/super-off-road/3030-32988\">Super Off Road</a>) You have access to only two vehicles in this mode; the free star (Where you can point in the direction you want to go) and the steer star (which has relative controls)</p><h3>City Trial</h3><p>Players have a limited time to traverse a city, collecting stat-building powerups to be used against other players in various minigames after the allotted time limit expires. You'll start in the Compact Star which has lower stats. By holding the action button and down on the control stick, you can dismount your Air Ride in order to board another one. However you won't be able to obtain any power ups while not riding a vehicle. Playing in Free Run mode allows you to use any unlocked vehicle</p><h2>LAN Play</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14355/2402308-emulator.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2402308\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14355/2402308-emulator.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2402308\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/14355/2402308-emulator.png\"/></a><figcaption>Four players playing in system link mode.</figcaption></figure><p>This game is one of the few titles compatible with the Broadband Adapater. Up to four systems can be linked together. When two systems are linked, up to two players can play on one system, however when playing with three or more systems, only one player per console can play. Any unlocked content located on the memory card can be used for LAN play. Only <b>Air Ride</b> and <b>City Trial</b> modes are playable with most of the customizable options available.</p><h2>Checklist</h2><p>The game also features several unlockables that become available via an achievement system labeled as the Checklist. This consists of a board with several panels that turn around only when certain conditions have been met. Some challenges will also reward additional vehicles, characters, songs in the Sound Test and more. Revealing purple spaces also allows you to clear a challenge without actually having to fulfill it's normal requirements. Not all challenges can be unlocked through this method however.

The first game in the <a href=\"/kirby/3025-420\" data-ref-id=\"3025-420\">long-running series</a> starring pink puffball <a href=\"/kirby/3005-726\" data-ref-id=\"3005-726\">Kirby</a>, Kirby's Dream Land is a simplistic and cutesy platformer in which the player has the ability to inhale objects, including enemies, and spit them out as projectiles. Unlike most platformers, Kirby can also fly indefinitely without assistance from <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power-ups</a>.</p><p>The game's plot involves <a href=\"/king-dedede/3005-1301\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1301\">King Dedede</a>, a large penguin and the self-proclaimed King of <a href=\"/dream-land/3035-340\" data-ref-id=\"3035-340\">Dream Land</a>, who has stolen all of Dream Land's food for a large feast. It's up to Kirby to confront Dedede and his minions in order to retrieve the stolen food.</p><p>Kirby's Dream Land was conceived by HAL developer <a href=\"/masahiro-sakurai/3040-66996\" data-ref-id=\"3040-66996\"> Masahiro Sakurai</a>. The protagonist's simple design was first used as a placeholder sprite by the development team, who intended to eventually replace the character with a more complex design. Originally named \"Popopo\" (the game's working title during development was \"Twinkle Popo\"), the main character's name was later changed to \"Kirby\" in reference to a brand of <a href=\"/vacuum-cleaner/3055-3084\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3084\">vacuum cleaners</a>. The game also contains references to HAL's preceding <a href=\"/adventures-of-lolo/3025-781\" data-ref-id=\"3025-781\">Adventures of Lolo</a> series, most notably the second stage boss fight against <a href=\"/lolo/3005-1598\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1598\">Lololo</a> and <a href=\"/lala/3005-1862\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1862\">Lalala</a>.</p><p>The game was digitally re-released for the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a> via <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> in 2011.

Kirby has the ability to suck in enemies and then shoot them out as projectiles. Pressing Down on the directional pad will make Kirby duck; if he has something in his mouth, this makes Kirby swallow the object to dispose of it. Pressing Up causes Kirby to inflate with air, allowing him to fly through the air indefinitely. If Kirby exhales afterward, he expels an puff of air which can be used as a weaker projectile. While floating or holding an object in his mouth, Kirby is slower and becomes an easier target for enemy attacks.</p><p>Kirby can eat certain food items to restore his six <a href=\"/health/3015-130\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health points</a>; touching or inhaling the food will instantly restore some of his health. Kirby's Dream Land contains two healing items: \"<a href=\"/energy-drinks/3055-1060\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1060\">Pep Brew</a>\", a beverage which heals two points of health, and the \"Bag of Magic Food\" (later known as a <a href=\"/maxim-tomato/3055-391\" data-ref-id=\"3055-391\">Maxim Tomato</a>), which fully restores Kirby's health. There are also a variety of power-ups that Kirby can collect throughout the game to gain special abilities or attacks:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/bomb/3055-97\" data-ref-id=\"3055-97\"><strong>Bomb</strong></a>: Kirby can toss this item at enemies to create a large explosion, which can also damage Kirby if he's too close to the blast.</li><li><strong>Spicy Food</strong> (aka <a href=\"/superspicy-curry/3055-242\" data-ref-id=\"3055-242\">Superspicy Curry</a>): Kirby breathes damaging fire for several seconds.

The game also expands on and introduces many new concepts, some of which stayed for future Mario titles. Notably, Super Mario Bros. 3 was the first Mario game to feature a <a href=\"/world-map/3015-611\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">world map</a>, allowing the player a certain level of freedom, including the occasional opportunity to skip sections of levels.</p><p>The game follows the traditional formula of <a href=\"../../mario/94-177/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mario</a> chasing down <a href=\"../../bowser/94-337/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bowser</a> to rescue the kidnapped <a href=\"../../peach/94-709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Peach</a>, though this time around Mario also has to deal with Bowser's children and their powerful <a href=\"/airship/3055-154\" data-ref-id=\"3055-154\">airships</a>.</p><p>Because of the new world map, certain areas are blocked by <a href=\"../../hammer-bros/92-783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hammer Bros.</a>, which Mario must defeat (or he can put them to sleep using an item found in the game).

It is the smallest world in the game, its map taking up only one screen.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Desert Land</b> (World Two) - A desert world, as the name implies. Quicksand becomes a common obstacle, and one stage takes place inside of a pyramid.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Water Land</b> (World Three) - This world takes place next to the ocean. Levels begin to take place underwater, and even levels that are not underwater usually feature water of some kind.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Giant Land</b> (World Four) - Giant Land is very similar to Grass Land. The difference is that enemies and objects are all more than twice their normal size! Even so, most of them can be destroyed with the same amount of effort.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Sky Land</b> (World Five) - The first half of sky land is also similar to Grass Land. However, the tower stage that exists at the midpoint of this level will take Mario up into the sky, which means that the latter half of this world is composed mostly of air stages.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Ice Land</b> (World Six) - Ice Land's stages are all covered in ice. Mario will slip on ice if he is not carefully controlled, making control even more important than ever.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Pipe Land</b> (World Seven) - Pipe Land's stages feature an abundance of pipes! While the environments may be similar to Grass Land, pipes are absolutely everywhere in these stages, and Piranha Plants come with them.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Dark Land</b> (World Eight) - Dark Land features many stages that are similar to the auto-scrolling airship stages that end the other worlds. It does eventually feature a few \"normal\" stages that resemble earlier worlds, but even these appear to take place at night. Watch out, because nearly every enemy in the game can appear at any time. At the end waits Bowser's Castle.</li></ul><h2>Power-Ups</h2><p>Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the old powers from the first game, and it also adds some new, more abstract upgrades.</p><h4><a href=\"../../super-mushroom/93-49/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Mushroom</a></h4><p>The classic Super Mario Bros. item returns in Super Mario Bros. 3. It turns Mario into Super Mario, allowing him to take one more hit before he dies.</p><h4><a href=\"../../fire-flower/93-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire Flower</a></h4><p>The Fire Flower is another classic Super Mario Bros. item. It gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs and quickly destroy enemies.

If he runs for a while and gets his P-Meter high up, Mario can soar through the sky. Pressing B makes Mario spin, which slows down his descent and hits enemies that get whacked by the raccoon tail.</p><h4><a href=\"../../frog-suit/93-40/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frog Suit</a></h4><p>The Frog Suit is another new item, giving Mario the ability to swim faster in the water. However, he hops around on land, making him harder to control.</p><h4><a href=\"../../tanooki-suit/93-38/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanooki Suit</a></h4><p>Very similar to the Raccoon Suit, this item allows Mario to turn into a stone statue, making him invincible to enemies.

He is impervious to attack from below while he is in Kuribo's Shoe, like Piranha Plants. It is only available in level 5-3. The shoe has not appeared as a power up in any game since Super Mario Bros. 3</p><h4><a href=\"../../starman/93-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman</a></h4><p>Another classic Super Mario Bros. power-up, this makes Mario temporarily invincible. In certain levels, Mario can string Starmen one after the other to the end of a level by hitting the right blocks along the way before running out of invincibility.</p><h4><a href=\"/warp-whistle/3055-468\" data-ref-id=\"3055-468\">Warp Whistle</a></h4><p>A rare power-up that could only be found in some areas, this lets Mario skip a world at any time, mimicking the pipe zones from the first game.

Each Koopa is felled after three hits.</p><h4><a href=\"/larry-koopa/3005-2289\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2289\">Larry Koopa</a></h4><p>Larry has no real special abilities beyond jumping high after taking two hits. He is the boss of Grass Land. It is uncertain who Larry is actually named after, but it is speculated to be Lawrence Welk, a well-known accordionist.</p><h4><a href=\"/morton-koopa-jr/3005-2271\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2271\">Morton Koopa, Jr.</a></h4><p>Morton is the boss of Desert Land, and the second youngest of the <a href=\"/koopalings/3015-3991\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3991\">Koopalings</a>. He is loud-mouthed and hot-tempered. While his facial features (the star on his left eye) resemble those of KISS member <a href=\"/paul-stanley/3040-48671\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48671\">Paul Stanley</a>, Morton is actually named after Morton Downey, Jr. (which also explains the \"Jr.\" in Morton's name, not insinuating that Bowser's real name is Morton).</p><h4><a href=\"/wendy-o-koopa/3005-2260\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2260\">Wendy O. Koopa</a></h4><p>Wendy is the only female Koopaling, and also the only Koopaling to have completely circular magical attacks. She is the third youngest, and is often portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat. Wendy is named after Wendy O. Williams, the singer for the band The Plasmatics.</p><h4><a href=\"/iggy-koopa/3005-2308\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2308\">Iggy Koopa</a></h4><p>Iggy is the middle child of the Koopalings. He is considered a \"genius\", particularly in the cartoons, where he is twin brothers with Lemmy Koopa. His in-game representation differs from his artwork, in which he sports a rainbow <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mohawk/3055-1709\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1709\">mohawk</a>. In-game, he lacks this, and only has a blonde tuft of hair. Iggy is named after the influential punk artist <a href=\"/iggy-pop/3040-62826\" data-ref-id=\"3040-62826\">Iggy Pop</a>.</p><h4><a href=\"/roy-koopa/3005-2324\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2324\">Roy Koopa</a></h4><p>Roy is the third oldest Koopaling. He is a bully, and enjoys seeing others' pain. He is the largest of the Koopalings, and thus, the worst at jumping. However, when he lands, he causes a ground-shaking blast, which stuns the player if they are still on the ground.

They can also break some Blocks by hitting it from below and Spin Jump on Rotating Blocks to break them. This power-up glides across the ground before collected and can sometimes be found by running over special areas (like some bushes). All Yellow Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Running over checkpoint gates as regular Mario/Luigi automatically puts them in Super form.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10\" data-ref-id=\"3055-10\"><strong>Fire Flower</strong></a> - Transforms into Fire Mario/Luigi. In addition to the benefits of the Super Mushroom, they can now throw <a href=\"/fireball/3055-120\" data-ref-id=\"3055-120\">fireballs</a> (which can damage and destroy most enemies) by tapping the X or Y buttons. Performing a Spin Jump also throws fireballs on both sides of them. This power-up is usually stationary before collected. In the GBA remake, getting hit while in Fire form changes them into Super form (similar to <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>).</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/feather-cape/3055-525\" data-ref-id=\"3055-525\"><strong>Cape Feather</strong></a> - Transforms into Cape Mario/Luigi. In addition to the benefits of the Super Mushroom, they can now glide across the air by holding the X or Y buttons. In addition, making a running jump allows them to fly through the air (allowing them to sail with the cape by holding Up and Down on the joypad). This power-up floats left and right downward before collected. All Green Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Jumping on Super Koopas cause them to drop a Cape Feather.</li></ul><p>Somewhat similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, players can have the ability to store spare power-ups for use at a later time. If a player collects two of the same power-up (or if they collect a Super Mushroom while in Fire or Cape forms), it will be placed in the Reserve Box at the top of the <a href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">HUD</a>. Getting hit (or pressing the Select button in-game) causes the item to slowly descend from the Reserve Box. Also new to the game are Roulette Blocks, which can carry either of these power-ups (along with the Starman power-up below) and is chosen when the player hits the block.</p><p>In addition, Mario and Luigi can find two rare power-ups that do not permanently transform them, instead temporarily giving them a special ability:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/starman/3055-23\" data-ref-id=\"3055-23\"><strong>Starman</strong></a> - Grants them <a href=\"/temporary-invincibility/3015-266\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporary invincibility</a>, allowing them to bump onto any enemies to defeat them. Unlike previous games, players can chain combos by bumping onto enemies in quick succession (giving them easier <a href=\"/extra-life/3015-1806\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1806\">extra lives</a>). Usually found in Roulette Blocks.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Power Balloon</strong> - Temporarily inflates them allowing them to hover in the air and gradually float upwards. Found in only four levels and is not necessary for normal game progression (only required for reaching secret exits).</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Worlds</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340228\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-340228\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14477/340228-166.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Dinosaur Land.</figcaption></figure><p>There are over 75 levels in the game, each split into multiple areas (or \"Worlds\").

Completing all eight levels gives them a one-way Star Road back to Yoshi's House while changing the color scheme of the overworld (giving it a Fall apperance) and giving some enemies a Fall theme (<a href=\"/koopa-troopa/3015-2557\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2557\">Koopa Troopas</a> <a href=\"/halloween/3015-3967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3967\">wearing Mario masks</a>, both jumping <a href=\"/piranha-plant/3015-794\" data-ref-id=\"3015-794\">Piranha Plants</a> and Beanstalks becoming haunted <a href=\"/pumpkin/3055-2734\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2734\">pumpkins</a>, and <a href=\"/bullet-bill/3015-1581\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1581\">Bullet Bills</a> resembling <a href=\"/crow/3015-4907\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4907\">crow</a>-like <a href=\"/pidgit/3015-2989\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2989\">Pidgits</a>).</p><p>While four of the Star Roads have no exit routes in Dinosaur Land (unless previously unlocked), the fifth Star Road immediately links to the front door of <a href=\"/bowsers-castle/3035-685\" data-ref-id=\"3035-685\">Bowser's Castle</a>, allowing players to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">skip a large majority of the game</a>.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Amazing Flying Hammer Bro</h3><p>A flying enemy, throws hammers.

It is the last game in the franchise to feature the original art and gameplay style of Mega Man X (as well as the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/password/3015-38\" data-ref-id=\"3015-38\">password</a> system).</p><p>Set sometime after the events of Mega Man X2 (where X and the rebuilt Zero defeat the Maverick <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/sigma/3005-1837\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1837\">Sigma</a> for the second time), the Maverick rebellion becomes neutralized due to the technology of Reploid scientist <a href=\"/dr-doppler/3005-28897\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28897\">Dr. Doppler</a>. Reformed Mavericks form an utopia near the scientist (named Dopple Town) and lived peacefully before they suddenly go berserk and cause mayhem. Believing Doppler to be responsible, X and Zero must defeat the eight Maverick leaders of Dopple Town and foil the mad scientist's plans (while surviving his henchmen, <a href=\"/bit/3005-28898\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28898\">Bit</a> and <a href=\"/byte/3005-28899\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28899\">Byte</a>, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/vile/3005-5052\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5052\">a mysterious Maverick</a>).</p><p>An enhanced version of the game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan (on April 26, 1996) and Europe (published by <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc/3010-176\" data-ref-id=\"3010-176\">Virgin Interactive</a> on March 1997). While the core game remains the same, it includes animated <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/full-motion-video/3015-604\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\">full-motion video</a> cutscenes, a rearranged soundtrack, and new sound effects. This version was later released for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in Japan (on March 28, 1997) and North America (on October 5, 1998) and is included in the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-x-collection/3030-1483\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1483\">Mega Man X Collection</a> compilation for the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-2/3045-19\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gamecube/3045-23\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube</a> (released on January 10, 2006).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay has only somewhat differed from <a href=\"/mega-man-x2/3030-19801\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19801\">Mega Man X2</a> by making the wall jumping slightly easier to preform while reploids become tougher. The gameplay compared to the Mega Man series is much more fast paced with more tricky and more powerful mavericks than ever giving rise to more difficult battles. As a side point, their battles can be completed faster than other bosses in previous games, as they are more susceptible to their weakness, and take more damage from their attacks.</p><h2>Boss Robots(Mavericks)</h2><p>At the end of every level X must fight a boss to proceed, and after fighting all 8 bosses he goes to the final fight against Doppler and his army.

When Mega Man X steps into one of these capsules, it will come to life and change the appearance of Mega Man X. Here are descriptions of some of the Capsules:</p><p><u><b>Boots</b></u>(Nothing required)</p><p>Gives X the ability to dash again while in the air</p><p>Location-Blizzard Buffalo's lair</p><p><u><b>Gun</b></u></p><p>(Boots and T.Fang)</p><p>Allows X to charge up one level and fire two powerful shots; also X can charge special weapons.</p><p>Location-Neon Tiger's lair</p><p><u><b>Helmet</b></u></p><p>(Gun and Triad T.)</p><p>A map will appear at the beginning of the level to show X where hidden items are located.</p><p>Location-Drill Rhino's lair</p><p><u><b>Armor</b></u></p><p>(Boots, G.

After getting hurt a shield will automatically form around X to lessen damage by 1/2</p><p>Location-Volt Catfish's lair</p><h3>Robot Ride Armor</h3><p>In addition to the armor capsules, Dr. Light has set out 4 different armors known as robot ride armor. Mega Man X and Zero must find these 4 armors, each with different capabilities and functions. The armor looks like a giant robot that they can activate by jumping into it. Once X finds an armor, he may use the armor in any stage where he may find the Robot Ride platforms.</p><p>If X has found an armor, the platform will activate. A menu will appear just to the left of the platform, so use the game pad or the arrow keys to select which armor X would like to use. While in the robot ride armor, Mega Man X and Zero will not be damaged. The armor can be damaged, but can be healed by returning to the platform. If the armor is destroyed, X cannot use it again until he enters a new stage. He can also jump out if need be by jumping while holding up on the D-pad.</p><p><u><b>Robot Ride Armors</b></u></p><p><b>Chimera</b></p><p><b>Hawk</b></p><p><b>Frog</b></p><p><b>Kangaroo</b></p><h2><b>Soundtrack</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2062809\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2062809\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2062809-1.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Cover Art</figcaption></figure><p>In 2005 Capcom released a 5-disc box set called Capcom Music Generation Rockman X1~6.

Depending on which Capsule X finds, Dr. Light briefs him on what the upgrade does before allowing him to step into the Capsule to receive it (giving him a shiny new replacement piece for his armor).</p><ul><li><strong>Helmet Piece</strong> - Allows X to use his \"Item Tracer\", in which a cursor (shown on the screen) automatically zooms in to hidden passages. Found in Crystal Snail's stage.</li><li><strong>Body Piece</strong> - Allows X to perform the \"Giga Crush\" technique, which clears all enemies on the screen (but uses a gauge that only fills up by taking damage and can only be used once per level). X also takes 50% less damage from attacks. Found in Morph Moth's stage.</li><li><strong>Arm Pieces</strong> - Allows X to both charge up his special weapons (for an alternate, more powerful effect) and grants him an X-Buster on his other arm (allowing him to further charge his standard X-Buster, which fires two consecutive super-charged blasts that can cut through enemies). Found in Wheel Gator's stage.</li><li><strong>Leg Pieces</strong> - Allows X to <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/dash/3015-2290\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2290\">dash</a> in mid-air. Found in Overdrive Ostrich's stage.</li></ul><h3>Hidden Capsule</h3><p>Along with the four Capsules above, the game includes a very hidden fifth Capsule which grants X a powerful ability (in similar vein to the secret ability in the previous game).</p><p>If he manages to reach a certain point in the third stage of the X-Hunter's fortress after receiving all four armor parts and obtaining every Sub Tank and Life Up powerups, and then following a specific path (covered in spikes), he can reach a Capsule in which Dr. Light grants X the power to perform a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shoryuken/3015-496\" data-ref-id=\"3015-496\">Shoryuken</a> (made famous by <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/ryu/3005-103\" data-ref-id=\"3005-103\">Ryu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/ken-masters/3005-212\" data-ref-id=\"3005-212\">Ken</a> of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/capcom/3010-367\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom's</a> <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter/3025-331\" data-ref-id=\"3025-331\">Street Fighter</a> series).</p><p>By inputting a specific combination (forward, then down, then down and forward, then the Attack button) while X is on the ground and has a full Life Energy gauge, X performs a powerful close-ranged rising <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/uppercut/3015-1128\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1128\">uppercut</a> that can deal serious damage to bosses.

There also appears to be new power-ups not included in any previous Mario titles, including <a href=\"/luigi/3005-370\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\">Luigi</a> Mushrooms, which make Mario much taller and skinnier, and Mystery Mushrooms, which give Mario one of a variety of costumes based on other Nintendo characters.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The player can freely switch between edit and play mode at any time, allowing the player to play-test stages in progress. Most elements of a stage's layout can be edited, including the placement of pits and their width, pipe placement and height, question mark blocks and other floating blocks, moving platforms, coins, and enemies. Items can be freely arranged in ways that would not be seen in a real Mario game, such as by stacking a <a href=\"/goomba/3015-2891\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2891\">Goomba</a>, a <a href=\"/koopa-troopa/3015-2557\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2557\">Koopa Troopa</a>, and a <a href=\"/piranha-plant/3015-794\" data-ref-id=\"3015-794\">Piranha Plant</a> on top of each other. Players can also include a variety of extra sound effects in their levels, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoQF9zWVsZk\" rel=\"nofollow\">ones they record themselves</a>, though unfortunately, to prevent potentially exposing children to obscene language or noises, these recorded sound effects are not included when levels are shared online. These sound effects can be triggered by things such as enemies performing an attack, objects emerging from pipes, or even simply walking Mario over an invisible trigger.</p><p>Mario Maker supports the sharing of levels online as well a ranking system for the most popular levels. The game also includes a 100 Mario Challenge mode, wherein players must complete 16 randomly selected user levels with only 100 lives at their disposal, and a harder variant known as 10 Mario Challenge, where the player only has 10 lives to clear 8 premade courses.</p><h2>Amiibo Support</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2775624\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/24/249540/2775624-8185760408-8_bit.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.56285714285714\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/24/249540/2775624-8185760408-8_bit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2775624\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/24/249540/2775624-8185760408-8_bit.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The \"30th Anniversary 8-bit Mario\" amiibo, in both Classic and Modern varieties</figcaption></figure><p>A special \"30th Anniversary 8-bit Mario\" amiibo was released alongside the game in Classic colors faithful to the original Super Mario Bros. sprite and Modern colors which are more in line with Mario's current appearance. The amiibo itself is much larger than the standard figures and, appropriately, when used with the game will allow the player to add a Mega Mushroom to their course, causing Mario (or an enemy it's been applied to) to grow much bigger than normal.</p><p>Super Mario Maker supports over 100 other amiibo figures/cards, using them to unlock various costumes based on the appropriate character for use in the game which can be donned by using a Mystery Mushroom power up. However, these costumes can only be used in the original Super Mario Bros. tileset. These costumes (as well as many others not tied to amiibo) can also be unlocked on their own without the use of the amiibo figures by completing various challenges such as the 100 Mario Challenge.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Super Mario Maker was announced during Nintendo's digital event at <a href=\"/e3-2014/3015-7932\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7932\">E3 2014</a> on June 10, 2014 as simply Mario Maker.

The gameplay itself is entirely <a data-ref-id=\"3015-169\" href=\"/on-rails/3015-169\">on rails</a>, consisting of Pepsiman running from one end of the level to the other, picking up <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1900\" href=\"/in-game-advertising/3015-1900\">Pepsi cans and using Pepsi-branded vending machines</a> on the side. Some levels mix up the gameplay by either controlling Pepsiman in awkward situations that change the controls or by having him run away from a renegade gigantic Pepsi can on the prowl. Additionally, the game also features live action <a data-ref-id=\"3015-604\" href=\"/full-motion-video/3015-604\">FMVs</a> that depict a portly American man who serves little purpose other than to further advertise the products depicted within the game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is divided into four areas, each made up of two stages. Each area starts off with Pepsiman being approached by person with a problem, usually involving people whose thirst desperately needs to be quenched, preferably with Pepsi. Once the game get under way, there's a countdown timer and the level has to be finished before it reaches zero. Viewed from the third person perspective, Pepsiman runs through the level automatically while the player controls his direction, left or right, and three key movements: sliding, sprinting and jumping. Among other things, Pepsiman has to jump over open manholes, avoid oncoming traffic, slide under semi trucks and through people's homes, and dodge garbage/furniture falling out of trucks driving in front of him. The player also has to collect small cans of Pepsi along the way. There are one hundred in each stage, and collecting them increases Pepsiman's lives. With each stage the difficulty increases, and the last levels are known to be brutally challenging.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Despite being released only in Japan, all the game menus, dialogue and FMVs are in English, making it very import friendly in the West.</li><li>Before Pepsiman, the developer, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-869\" href=\"/kid-corp/3010-869\">KID Corp.</a>, was better known for making adult games for the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3134\" href=\"/sega-saturn/3055-3134\">Sega Saturn</a>.</li><li>The game was so popular in the Arab world that someone decided to make an Arabic dubbed version of the game.</li><li>Some levels in the game are based on Pepsi's television ads where Pepsiman originated from.</li><li>The game disk can be played as an audio CD, and includes 7 tracks, all of which are background music of the game's levels.</li><li>This isn't the first or only game to feature Pepsiman; he was an unlockable character in the Japanese version of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5662\" href=\"/fighting-vipers/3030-5662\">Fighting Vipers</a>.</li></ul>", "deck": "An on-rails running game, Pepsiman places players in the role of Pepsi's Japanese mascot, who must quench people's thirst with his name-brand goods.", "aliases": null, "image": {"icon_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/5150/2118178-tumblr_lyojj7wjmz1qzurbt.jpg", "medium_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/2118178-tumblr_lyojj7wjmz1qzurbt.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/5150/2118178-tumblr_lyojj7wjmz1qzurbt.jpg", "small_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5150/2118178-tumblr_lyojj7wjmz1qzurbt.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/5150/2118178-tumblr_lyojj7wjmz1qzurbt.jpg", "screen_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/5150/2118178-tumblr_lyojj7wjmz1qzurbt.jpg", "super_url": "http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5150/2118178-tumblr_lyojj7wjmz1qzurbt.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pepsiman/3030-13795/", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-13795/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": "1999-03-04 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": null, "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:11:15", "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_day": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-22/", "abbreviation": "PS1", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/playstation/3045-22/", "id": 22, "name": "PlayStation"}], "id": 13795, "resource_type": "game", "name": "Pepsiman"}, "platform": "PS1", "title": "Pepsiman"}

After searching the town for the <a href=\"../../kokiri-sword/93-755/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri Sword</a>, and finding enough <a href=\"../../rupee/93-44/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rupees</a> to buy the <a href=\"../../deku-shield/93-1967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Shield</a>, Link is allowed to enter the presence of the <a href=\"../../great-deku-tree/94-2682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Deku Tree</a>. Link finds out that he has been summoned to attempt to save the Deku Tree from death after being cursed by an evil man. After defeating the curse, but failing to save the Great Deku Tree, Link is told the origin of the world of Hyrule\u2026..</p><blockquote><p>\"A long time ago . . .</p><p>Before life began, before the world had formed, three golden goddesses descended upon the chaotic land of Hyrule.</p><p>They were Din, the goddess of power, Nayru, the goddess of wisdom and Farore, the goddess of courage.</p><p>Din, with her strong flaming arms, cultivated the land to create the earth.</p><p>Nayru poured her wisdom onto the earth to give the spirit of law to the world.</p><p>Farore's rich soul created all life forms who would uphold the law.</p><p>These great goddesses returned to the heavens, leaving behind the golden sacred Triforce.Since then, the Triforce has become the basis for Hyrule's providence.</p><p>Where the Triforce Stood became sacred land.\"</p></blockquote><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22629/822529-triforce_oot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822529\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22629/822529-triforce_oot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822529\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22629/822529-triforce_oot.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The Triforce - A sacred object left by the gods in Hyrule.</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../great-deku-tree/94-2682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Tree</a> then reveals that the \u201cwicked man from the desert\u201d that cursed him was searching for one of three sacred stones, the keys to opening the door of time located in Temple of Time and gaining access to the <a href=\"../../triforce/93-18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triforce</a>. After giving Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the <a href=\"../../kokiris-emerald/93-1458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri's Emerald</a>, the Deku Tree tells Link that he is different from all the other Kokiri and has a destiny that lies beyond the forest. Before he dies he sends Link to search out the other two spiritual stones, and specifically to the <a href=\"../../hyrule-castle/95-1765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule Castle</a>. As the story unfolds it is learned that Link needs to stop the \u201cwicked man from the desert\u201d, named <a href=\"../../ganon/94-512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ganondorf</a>, from gaining access to all three pieces of the Triforce and gaining the full power of the Goddesses.</p><p>Just as Link leaves Kokiri Forest, his old friend <a href=\"../../saria/94-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saria</a> gives him the Fairy Ocarina. A musical device capable of playing numerous melodies. As he steps onto <a href=\"../../hyrule-field/95-551/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule Field</a>, he meets a wise owl, <a href=\"../../kaepora-gaebora/94-3848/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaepora Gaebora</a>, who gives advice to Link on his quest. Link makes his way across the Hyrule Field and eventually arrives at Hyrule Castle. He storms through the market and reaches the castle gate. It is here that he meets <a href=\"../../malon/94-2657/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malon</a>, a dairy maid and daughter of the owner of Lon Lon Ranch, who she gives him an egg after stating that her dad is missing after doing a milk delivery. Being refused entry to the castle, Link climbs up some vines around the side of the gate and sneaks past all the guards to get into the castle. The only way in being a small trapdoor on the side of the building. However, this is blocked by a sleeping Talon, the missing owner of Lon Lon Ranch. Not being awoken by normal methods, Link waits a night and a day and the egg hatches into a Cuckoo. The Cuckoo wakes up Talon, who runs back home after he realizes that Malon is upset. Link now sneaks into the castle via the small trapdoor.</p><p>As he goes into the Castle, there are more guards patrolling the grounds. Link successfully sneaks past them and is greeted by <a href=\"../../zelda/94-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Zelda</a>. She tells the story of how Hyrule was created and how Ganondorf, the <a href=\"../../gerudo/92-858/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerudo</a> King, is trying to harness the power of the Triforce for himself. After agreeing to help the Princess, Link meets <a href=\"../../impa/94-2565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impa</a>, nurse of Zelda, who teaches him Zelda's lullaby and escorts him out of the castle, but not before giving him a note to allow him to climb <a href=\"../../death-mountain/95-69/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death Mountain.</a></p><p>Once back in Hyrule Field, Link goes back to Kokiri Forest to get Saria's Song, as it is one of the <a href=\"../../goron/92-857/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron's</a> favorite songs. However, Saria is nowhere to be seen, so Link searches for her and ends up in the Lost Woods, an eerie forest which seems to be an endless maze. After Link makes his way through the Lost Woods, with the help of Kaepora Gaebora, he eventually finds Saria sitting on a tree stump. It is here Link learns Saria's Song, this allows him to ask for Saria's advice whenever he needs it wherever he may be. Link makes his way to Death Mountain, and his second Spiritual Stone.</p><p>Making his way back through Hyrule Field, Link heads for <a href=\"../../kakariko-village/95-509/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kakariko Village</a>, at the base of Death Mountain. Once here, he shows the guard guarding the entrance to Death Mountain, the letter that Impa gave him and Link is granted permission to make his way up the dangerous mountain. Avoiding various <a href=\"../../tektite/92-2883/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tektites</a> and other dangers, Link finally arrives at <a href=\"../../goron-city/95-1601/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron City</a>. Encountering a locked door, Link plays Zelda's Lullaby and meets <a href=\"../../darunia/94-2559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darunia</a>, who refuses to talk to him as he is a bad mood. To brighten the atmosphere, Saria's Song is played and Darunia breaks into dance. Finally being in a good mood again, Darunia gives link the <a href=\"../../power-bracelet/93-817/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Bracelet</a>, which allows him to pick up Bomb Flowers. Using this new found strength, Link picks up a Bomb Flower and blows up the entrance to <a href=\"../../dodongos-cavern/95-565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dodongo's Cavern</a>.</p><p>Link makes his way through Dodongo's Cavern, fighting various enemies such as Keese, <a href=\"../../lizalfos/92-2878/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lizalfos</a> and Dodongos. He obtains the dungeon's treasure which are bombs. This allows him to carry bombs with him instead of depending on Bomb Flowers and the Goron Bracelet. Link makes his way through the dungeon and eventually reaches <a href=\"../../king-dodongo/94-2408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">King Dodongo</a>. After defeating King Dodongo and ridding Dodongo's Cavern of any threats, Darunia congratulates Link making him a 'brother' and gives him the second spiritual stone, the <a href=\"../../gorons-ruby/93-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron's Ruby</a>.</p><p>With two out of the three spiritual stones obtained, only the <a href=\"../../zoras-sapphire/93-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zora's Sapphire</a> remains. Link makes his way to the Zora domain, gaining entrance by playing Zelda's Lullaby. He speaks to the king of the Zoras who tells him that his daughter, <a href=\"../../princess-ruto/94-2561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Ruto</a> is missing and asks Link to go find her. Link can then take part in a diving game which if he completes, it will give him the silver scale. Using his new found ability to breathe underwater for longer, Link uses the secret entrance to Lake Hylia found in Zora's domain. It is here that he finds a message in a bottle. The message states that Princess Ruto has gone to see <a href=\"../../jabun/94-3601/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jabu Jabu</a>. Link shows the king this message and the king allows him to pass. Jabu Jabu has been acting strangely recently and when Link feeds him a fish, Jabu Jabu engulfs Link.</p><p>When inside Jabu Jabu, Link finds Princess Ruto, who is rather rude. Link has to escort her around the body while avoiding the enemies that plague the area. As Link reaches the end of the dungeon, he fights the dungeon boss using his new found boomerang. Once defeated, Princess Ruto is saved and she gives him the Zora's Sapphire as an engagement present stating that she will get married to Link in the future.</p><p>Now that Link has all three spiritual stones he makes his way back towards Hyrule Castle. As he reaches the gates of the market place, he sees Zelda and Impa ride out on horseback, Zelda notices Link and throws the Ocarina of Time back into the moat surrounding the castle. Just after they disappear, Ganondorf comes storming through the gates and asks Link where the princess went. He refuses to answer and then is hit by Ganondorf's thunderball.</p><p>When Link awakens, he jumps into the moat and finds the Ocarina of Time and proceeds to the Temple of Time. He opens the Door of Time by placing all three spiritual stones on the alter, this reveals the Master Sword resting in the Pedestal of Time. After Link unsheathes the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time he unknowingly and unwillingly gives Ganondorf access to the Sacred Realm.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10314-hyrule.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10314\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56484848484848\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/10314-hyrule.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10314\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/10314-hyrule.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/10314-hyrule.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Map of Hyrule, from The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time</figcaption></figure><p>Ocarina of Time takes place in two different time settings with players controlling both young Link and adult Link. The game starts when Link is a young boy trying to stop Ganondorf from gaining the Triforce. Upon gaining access to the <a href=\"../../temple-of-time/95-1439/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple of Time</a> and the <a href=\"../../master-sword/93-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Sword</a>, Link travels seven years into the future. Link learns that the time travel happens because, although Link is the <a href=\"../../chosen-one/92-3870/\" rel=\"nofollow\">chosen one</a> to remove the Master Sword from its stone sealed sheath, he must be of a certain age to wield it. Therefore Link is trapped in a sort of \u201chibernation\u201d until he is old enough to fulfill his destiny. When Link awakens he finds that in his absence, Ganondorf has used the Triforce of Power to take control of Hyrule and turn it into a post-apocalyptic world. Link must now embark on a quest to save the once beautiful land of Hyrule.</p><h2>Control Scheme</h2><p>In a situation similar to the development of <a href=\"../../super-mario-64/61-2931/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Mario 64</a> (released in 1996), Nintendo faced the difficult task of translating one of gaming's most beloved franchises into <a href=\"../../3d/92-1430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3D</a>, which meant a complete overhaul of the series' classic design mechanics.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341787\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341787\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341787-boss09.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Only the Great King of Evil can stand up to the power of Z-Targeting with his aura of evil.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the previous, top-down 2D Zelda games, Ocarina of Time utilized a completely 3D view. The player could control both Link's direction and the velocity of movement via the Analog Stick. The camera in Ocarina of Time floated around Link (as opposed to the greater camera controls in Super Mario 64), and could be instantly directed behind Link by pressing the Z button. Although the B button permanently controlled use of the sword, the games various other items (such as the Bow and the <a href=\"../../hook-shot/93-383/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hookshot</a>) could be mapped onto the Left, Right, and Down C-Buttons, allowing Link to access more of his weaponry without pulling up a menu.</p><p><a href=\"../../nintendo/65-90/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo</a> brought two major control innovations to bear in Ocarina of Time. The first, and most obvious, new control feature was <a href=\"../../lock-on/92-416/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lock-On Targeting</a> (referred to as Z-Targeting in the game). Pressing the Z button when Link was near a person, enemy, sign or interactive part of the environment caused the camera to lock onto the target (in game, Link's fairy, Navi, would fly to the nearby target and Link would turn his eyes directly towards Navi's new location). From the locked on position, Link could strafe around his target, use rolls and flips to dodge enemy attacks, and easily interact/talk to <a href=\"../../non-player-character/92-967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPCs </a>in three dimensional space.</p><p>The idea of locking on to a target was revolutionary: game programmers and designers, who were trying to understand how characters would be able to physically interact in 3D, couldn\u2019t understand how to make a game with the same type of tight control they could achieve in a 2D perspective. Characters could never line up properly with their targets and movement speed was too slow. Many games had control schemes that confused players. In Ocarina of Time however, players could instantly face and run directly to characters, would always be facing toward an enemy, and had more control over <a href=\"../../link/94-191/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Link</a>.</p><p>The second key innovation of Ocarina of Time was the creation of the context-sensitive buttons. Rather than map every single one of Link's abilities to a different button on the N64 controller, or only provide Link with a handful of abilities, Nintendo mapped many \"secondary\" control features to the A button. When in a certain situation or \"context\" (in front of a door, near a block, in combat, playing the Ocarina, riding Epona), the on-screen A button would display a word, indicating what the button could currently be used for (e.g. opening doors, pushing blocks, jump attacks in combat, putting the Ocarina away, speeding <a href=\"../../epona/94-1968/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Epona</a> up). This was a more subtle change to the series, but Context-Sensitive buttons became the industry standard way for developers to assign controller buttons, using permanent assignment only for important actions, while letting a player use \"secondary functions\" only in the proper context.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341837\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341837\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341837-bottle01.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The A button is used to scrolls through text, roll, read signs, and dodge enemy attacks.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the biggest surprise for players who purchased the game was that, despite the new perspective, brand new controls, and 3D graphics, Ocarina of Time was still a full-blooded Zelda game. Sticking to its roots, the game led players through nine different dungeons, having them complete tricky puzzles and defeat big bosses along the way.</p><p>Ocarina of Time, like the Zelda games that came before it, is primarily an exploration and puzzle solving game, with sword combat, horseback riding, and boss fights playing providing a change of pace. The player progresses through the game by guiding Link to one of the nine dungeons and collecting a mystical artifact at the end (three jewels in the first half of the game, six medallions in the second half). Each of these dungeons is filled with puzzles that hinder Link's progress, and the player must solve them to continue their quest. In every dungeon (after the first one) players will encounter a \"Sub-Boss\", a powerful enemy that the player will be forced to do battle with. Defeating the Sub-Boss will lead the player to an item that will be necessary to solve puzzles farther in the dungeon. At the very end, players will encounter the Boss of the dungeon, who can only be defeated with tactical use of the new weapon retrieved in the dungeon (and some well placed sword slashes).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341913\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-341913\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/341913-f06.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Players will still guide Link through dungeons, collect keys, and fight Ganon -- only this time in 3D</figcaption></figure><p>Puzzles in the dungeons often share very basic similarities (there's quite a bit of time spent pushing blocks, standing on switches, and pushes blocks onto switches). However, each dungeon has a \"theme\" that changes the way the player moves through the dungeon. The Water Temple, for example, can only be beaten if the player raises and lowers the water levels, which they can only do at specific parts of the dungeon. The Shadow Dungeon, on the other hand, is filled with invisible walls and traps, not to mention mirages. The player can only see through these disguises with the <a href=\"../../lens-of-truth/93-1961/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lens of Truth</a>.</p><h2>Main Characters</h2><p>Ocarina of Time boasted a cast of dozens of characters, including both series stalwarts (like Link, Princess Zelda and Ganon) while also introducing new denizens of the land of <a href=\"../../hyrule/95-13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule</a> that would go on to be featured in later installments of the series.</p><h3><a href=\"/link/3005-191\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a>: The Hero of Time</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316574-oot_link05.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316574\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3604651162791\" data-width=\"172\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 172px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316574-oot_link05.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316574\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316574-oot_link05.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316574-oot_link05.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Young Link</figcaption></figure><p>The main character of Ocarina of Time, and the protagonist of nearly all the <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda</a> games (with rare exception). Like previous <a href=\"../../the-legend-of-zelda/62-9/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zelda games</a>, the player may choose any name they want for the main character(including their own), but the default character name is Link. The name Link, according to <a href=\"../../shigeru-miyamoto/72-614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, comes from a literal interpretation of what the main character is in a video game: a link between the player and the game.</p><p>The Link featured in Ocarina of Time is not a continuation of his adventures from the <a href=\"../../nes/60-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NES</a>, <a href=\"../../game-boy/60-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Game Boy</a>, and <a href=\"../../snes/93-2795/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Nintendo</a> games, but a whole new Link in a whole new story unrelated to those previous games. Ocarina of Time helped to cement the fact that the Legend of Zelda games were not a series of stories connected together in a linear timeline, but rather a retelling of the same story: different plot details, character interactions, and action sequences may occur, but the core theme(boy saves princess/world) remains the same throughout many of the main story.</p><p>The player will eventually control two different \"versions\" of Link: first as a boy, and then later as a young adult, after he <a href=\"../../time-travel/92-73/\" rel=\"nofollow\">travels forward in time</a> 7 years. This older incarnation of Link is widely regarded as the most popular representation of the series' protagonist, and fan clamor for a game starring the older, more \"mature\" Link was so strong that Nintendo obliged with the release of <a href=\"../../the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/61-19467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> in 2006 for both the <a href=\"../../gamecube/60-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GameCube</a> and <a href=\"../../wii/60-36/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wii</a>, which were designed around the mature Link aesthetic.</p><p>Link begins Ocarina of Time as a small boy, a native of the <a href=\"../../kokiri/92-1303/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri</a> tribe designated as protectors of the forests of <a href=\"../../hyrule/95-13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hyrule</a>.

At the outset of the game, Link is trouble by strange dreams, visions of a man dressed in black from the west whose presence seems to be a threat (effectively predicting the invasion of Hyrule by <a href=\"../../ganon/94-512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ganondorf</a> and the Gerudo Tribe).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316573\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.276\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316573\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/316573-oot_link04.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Adult Link</figcaption></figure><p>As Link is awakened from his slumber, he meets <a href=\"../../navi/94-1176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Navi</a>, the fairy and companion throughout the game.

Despite Link's triumph over the monster deep inside the Tree's Roots, Link was too late to save the Great Deku Tree, as the curse had already taken its toll. With it's last wish, the Great Deku Tree gave Link a quest: he must leave the forest and travel across the world to Hyrule, and present a mysterious green stone, the <a href=\"../../kokiris-emerald/93-1458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kokiri Emerald</a>, to Princess Zelda, implying that she would know how to stop Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule.</p><p>Link's journey will take him to the <a href=\"../../zelda/94-5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Princess Zelda</a>, and together the two would hatch a plan to defeat Ganondorf by acquiring the <a href=\"../../triforce/93-18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triforce</a>, the mystical relics that helped to preserve the land and make it flourish after the goddesses created Hyrule. The Triforce was also the object of Ganondorf's desires, as the mystical triangles were able to grant any wish the holder of the relic desired. Link and Zelda decided to get to the Triforce before Ganondorf by getting to the Triforce first. To access the <a href=\"../../sacred-realm/95-1593/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sacred Realm</a> (where the Triforce has been stored by the gods), Link must locate two more sacred stones, the <a href=\"../../gorons-ruby/93-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goron's Ruby</a> and the <a href=\"../../zoras-sapphire/93-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zora's Sapphire</a>.

The young Princess Zelda won't be seen again until the player has completed the game.</p><p>When Link awakens in the Temple of Time seven years in the future, he is greeted by the mysterious Sheik, the last surviving member of the Sheikah, a tribe dedicated to the protection of the royal family. Sheik describes to Link the new world, one controlled and maintained by Ganondorf from the safety of Hyrule Castle. Sheik points Link towards the first <a href=\"../../sages-of-hyrule/92-2248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage</a>, the Sage of the Forest, and gives Link hints about the tools he will need to help save and awaken the various Sages. Sheik will eventually teach Link special \"warp\" songs that will instantly whisk the Hero of Time to the entrance of the five dungeons, or send him back to the <a href=\"../../master-sword/93-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Sword</a>'s pedestal at the Temple of Time, making the navigation of Hyrule much easier.</p><p>After Link awakens all six Sages, he returns to meet Sheik at the <a href=\"../../temple-of-time/95-1439/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple of Time</a>. Sheik tells Link that, although Ganondorf was the ruler of Hyrule, his victory of the land was not complete. Ganondorf only possessed one piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Power. Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Wisdom, on the other hand, was bound on the hand of a mysterious \"seventh sage\", the leader of the other six. To Link's (and the player's) shock, Sheik removes his mask and vestments, and reveals himself to be none other than the Princess Zelda! Her disguise was a ruse to keep the Princess out of Ganondorf's clutches to protect the Triforce of Courage. As the legendary Seventh Sage, Zelda uses her power to grant Link a weapon, the mystical Arrows of Time, that could penetrate any darkness and fill it with light. However, upon revealing her true self, Ganondorf captures the Princess and brings her to Hyrule Castle. Only Link can rescue her from his clutches, so he sets off to <a href=\"../../ganons-tower/95-1764/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ganon's castle</a>, and ascends to the top and faces the Evil King. Zelda is released upon Link's victory, but the tower starts to collapse, and the two have to escape before they're buried along with it. She helps open the gates that will lead the two to the exit and escape just as the building is destroyed. After a final battle between Link and Ganon, Zelda uses her powers to hold Ganon in place so Link can deliver the final blow to the beast. She then uses her powers in conjunction with the six sages to seal Ganon within the Sacred Realm. With Hyrule saved, Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood, where he is supposed to be.</p><h3><a href=\"/navi/3005-1176\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1176\">Navi the Fairy</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-395030\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.92763157894737\" data-width=\"152\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 152px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-395030\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4253/395030-navi.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Hey!\" \"Listen!\"</figcaption></figure><p>Navi is one of the mysterious fairy's of the Deku Forest.

Ganondorf is from the Gerudo Tribe which is made up primarily of women except for their King and is located in the desert to the west of Hyrule. Ganondorf came to power by simply being the chosen male child to be born every hundred years. He then uses his status as King of the Gerudo to make peace with the King of Hyrule and become an adviser to the king. As a young child Princess Zelda senses something dishonest and evil about Ganondorf as he is making a truce with her father. It is through this suspicion that Princess Zelda recruits Link to help her keep Ganondorf from achieving his goal, whatever it may be.

Can be used to make beans sprout into a transportation vine, often leading to hidden and otherwise unreachable areas.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Key Equipment</h2><ul><li>Kokiri Knife - The primary sword used by Young Link, as when he claims the Master Sword he transitions into Adult Link. The weakest of all of the swords with the smallest range.</li><li><a href=\"../../master-sword/93-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master Sword</a> - The main sword of the game. The second strongest sword. Can be used by Adult Link only. When placed back in the Temple of Time, the player resumes as Young Link.</li><li>Giant's Knife - Two-handed, breaks easily.</li><li>Biggoron's Sword - Two-handed, does not break. Requires completing a long task with many steps before it can be acquired.</li><li><a href=\"../../deku-shield/93-1967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Shield</a> - The first shield in the game. This is an item that cannot be used by adult Link. This is the primary shield for Young Link as it is the only shield that he can use to actually protect himself. The flaw with this shield is that it burns up if it comes into contact with any fire.</li><li><a href=\"../../hylian-shield/93-479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hylian Shield</a> - The Hylian Shield is the main shield throughout the game. It can be used for all the same things as the Deku Shield with the added benefit of being able to block fire attacks. Young Link can actually equip this shield, however it is too heavy for him to lift. When holding the trigger to block as Young Link with the Hylian Shield equipped Link simply crouches, protecting his back from damage. The only difference between this shield and the mirror shield is that it cannot reflect light.</li><li><a href=\"../../mirror-shield/93-512/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mirror Shield</a> - The Mirror Shield is the third shield in the game. It is found in the Spirit Temple. The mirror shield has a shiny surface and is used to be a surface to bounce light off of. This is important for completing the Spirit Temple and beating the Spirit Temple boss, Twinrova.</li><li>Kokiri Tunic - Standard green tunic. Link begins the game wearing it.</li><li>Goron Tunic - Protects against heat. Red in color.</li><li>Zora Tunic - Lets Link breathe under water. Blue in color.</li><li><a href=\"../../iron-boots/93-538/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Boots</a> - The Iron Boots are found in the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon right before entering the Water Temple. These boots are equipment modifiers like the Hover Boots and the Tunics in the game. When equipped the boots slow down Link and make him take very heavy steps. This is used to have link sink to the bottom of water so he can walk on the surface. This is necessary for completing the Water Temple.</li><li>Hover Boots - The Hover Boots are procured in the Shadow Temple and act as one of the equipment modifiers in the game as opposed to a C-Button item. When these are equipped Links steps become slippery as if he were running on ice. The benefit is that Link can run between two platforms and float a small distance between them which is good for gaining some distance.</li><li><a href=\"../../ocarina/93-62/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ocarina of Time</a> - The Ocarina of Time is the second Ocarina that Link gets in the game. The first one is the Fairy Ocarina. The Ocarina of Time can be played to warp the the entrance areas of every Temple in the game.</li><li><a href=\"../../deku-stick/93-1968/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deku Stick</a> - These fragile sticks are a consumable weapon much like bombs. They are dropped from Deku Babas. The sticks have a long range and one of the highest damage modifiers in the game. They can also be lit and used to light sconces and torches, which is used to solve puzzles.</li><li>Fairy Slingshot - The Fairy Slingshot is the first dungeon item found in the game. It is found inside the tree dungeon as Young Link. This acts as Young Link's primary ranged weapon as the Fairy Bow acts the same way for adult Link.</li><li>Fairy Bow - The Fairy Bow is the first dungeon item found as adult Link. The Fairy Bow is found in the Forest Temple. The Fairy Bow is needed to beat Phantom Ganon and is very helpful in handling final Ganon at the end of the game. It is often used for puzzles throughout the game. There are three elemental modifiers which can be added to the arrows. The Fire Arrows are good for lighting torches on fire. The Ice Arrow is good for freezing enemies. And the Light Arrow is strong against evil.</li><li>Hookshot / Longshot - The Hookshot is needed to enter the Forest Temple as Link. This makes it one of the first necessary items to procure as adult Link. The Hookshot can be received after racing Dampe in the Kakariko graveyard. The Longshot is an upgrade for the Hookshot and acts as the dungeon weapon for the Water Temple. The Longshot is needed to reach the final boss room of the Water Temple. The Longshot is also needed for beating the Water Temple boss, Morpha</li><li>Megaton Hammer - The Megaton Hammer is found in the Fire Temple as Link. Using the C-Button that the hammer is attached to can cause the hammer to be swung horizontally to knock barriers out of the way, or hammered vertically downward to crush things. The Megaton Hammer is crucial for beating the boss of the Fire Temple, Volvagia. The Megaton Hammer is also the best way to defeat the Shadow Link mini-boss in the Water Temple. Since Shadow Link copies all sword attacks that regular Link uses switching to the Megaton Hammer confuses Shadow Link.</li><li><a href=\"../../lens-of-truth/93-1961/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lens of Truth</a> - The Lens of Truth is one of the dungeon items in Ocarina of Time. The Lens of Truth is found in the first half of the Shadow Temple when Young Link goes into the Bottom of the Well mini-dungeon. Much like the Ice Cavern mini-dungeon before the Water Temple the player receives a key item needed for Link to complete the following dungeon. The Lens of Truth is used to spot fake walls and other hidden things which Link can walk through or on. The Lens of Truth is crucial for Adult Link to navigate the Shadow Temple. It is also used to fight the Shadow Temple's boss, Bongo Bongo.</li><li>Bottles - There are four bottles to be obtained throughout Ocarina of Time. Bottles can be used to store potions, milk, fairies, or Poe ghosts. To use items like the Poe ghosts or fairies there is no need to equip the bottle. Fairies will automatically resurrect Link with full health when he dies, and the Poe ghosts can be cashed in by simply talking to the vendor.</li></ul><h2>Reception</h2><p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time received universal critical acclaim and had a huge commercial success. It was the best selling game of 1998, with up to 2.5 million sales, even though it was released only 39 days before the end of the year. The game was praised for the intuitive controls, depth, and wonderful story. The games received Perfect 10 scores from numerous websites and magazines and won many Game Of The Year Awards. Ocarina of Time has often been called the greatest game of all time and to this day remains a classic.</p><h2>Nintendo 3DS Remake</h2><p>It was announced at <a href=\"../../e3-2010/92-4529/\" rel=\"nofollow\">E3 2010</a> that Ocarina of Time would be getting it's first real remake on Nintendo 3DS with <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d/3030-31776\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31776\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a>. The graphics, aside from being presented in full stereoscopic 3D and in 30 frames-per-second, have been greatly improved with redrawn textures and completely redone character models. Significant updates to the gameplay like being able to switch the Iron Boots on and off from the touch screen were also included. The game includes a mirrored version of version of Ocarina of Time: Master Quest, the harder alternate version of the game with re-arranged dungeon puzzles and other smaller changes.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><table data-max-width=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>\"Title Theme\"</td><td>1:20</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>\"Enter Ganondorf\"</td><td>0:13</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>\"Deku Tree\"</td><td>0:36</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>\"Fairy Flying\"</td><td>0:23</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>\"House\"</td><td>0:36</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>\"Kokiri Forest\"</td><td>1:01</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>\"Open Treasure Box\"</td><td>0:10</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>\"Item Catch\"</td><td>0:04</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>\"Small Item Catch\"</td><td>0:05</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>\"Shop\"</td><td>1:08</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>\"Battle\"</td><td>1:07</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td>\"Inside the Deku Tree\"</td><td>1:27</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td>\"Boss Battle\"</td><td>1:19</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td>\"Boss Clear\"</td><td>0:13</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td>\"Heart Container Get\"</td><td>0:05</td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td>\"Legend of Hyrule\"</td><td>1:58</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td>\"Spiritual Stone Get\"</td><td>0:16</td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td>\"Fairy Ocarina Get\"</td><td>0:11</td></tr><tr><td>19.</td><td>\"Hyrule Field Main Theme\"</td><td>4:43</td></tr><tr><td>20.</td><td>\"Kepora Gebora's Theme\"</td><td>1:00</td></tr><tr><td>21.</td><td>\"Market\"</td><td>0:59</td></tr><tr><td>22.</td><td>\"Shooting Gallery\"</td><td>0:39</td></tr><tr><td>23.</td><td>\"Hyrule Castle Courtyard\"</td><td>0:53</td></tr><tr><td>24.</td><td>\"Enter Zelda\"</td><td>0:06</td></tr><tr><td>25.</td><td>\"Ocarina \"Zelda's Lullaby\"\"</td><td>0:12</td></tr><tr><td>26.</td><td>\"Zelda's Theme\"</td><td>0:49</td></tr><tr><td>27.</td><td>\"Ocarina \"Epona's Song\"\"</td><td>0:09</td></tr><tr><td>28.</td><td>\"LonLon Ranch\"</td><td>2:08</td></tr><tr><td>29.</td><td>\"Mini Game\"</td><td>0:32</td></tr><tr><td>30.</td><td>\"Kakariko Village\"</td><td>1:44</td></tr><tr><td>31.</td><td>\"Ocarina \"Sun's Song\"\"</td><td>0:07</td></tr><tr><td>32.</td><td>\"Hyrule Field Morning Theme\"</td><td>0:37</td></tr><tr><td>33.</td><td>\"Goron City\"</td><td>1:38</td></tr><tr><td>34.</td><td>\"Ocarina \"Saria's Song\"\"</td><td>0:09</td></tr><tr><td>35.</td><td>\"Lost Woods\"</td><td>0:39</td></tr><tr><td>36.</td><td>\"Dodongo's Cavern\"</td><td>0:46</td></tr><tr><td>37.</td><td>\"Middle Boss Battle\"</td><td>1:07</td></tr><tr><td>38.</td><td>\"Dinosaur Boss Battle\"</td><td>1:08</td></tr><tr><td>39.</td><td>\"Zora's Domain\"</td><td>1:30</td></tr><tr><td>40.</td><td>\"Great Fairy's Fountain\"</td><td>0:35</td></tr><tr><td>41.</td><td>\"Potion Shop\"</td><td>0:52</td></tr><tr><td>42.</td><td>\"Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly\"</td><td>0:34</td></tr><tr><td>43.</td><td>\"Ocarina \"Song of Time\"\"</td><td>0:12</td></tr><tr><td>44.</td><td>\"Temple of Time\"</td><td>1:19</td></tr><tr><td>45.</td><td>\"Open Door of Temple of Time\"</td><td>0:15</td></tr><tr><td>46.</td><td>\"Master Sword\"</td><td>0:13</td></tr><tr><td>47.</td><td>\"Ganondorf's Theme\"</td><td>0:41</td></tr><tr><td>48.</td><td>\"Chamber of the Sages\"</td><td>1:43</td></tr><tr><td>49.</td><td>\"Medal Get Fanfare\"</td><td>0:14</td></tr><tr><td>50.</td><td>\"Sheik's Theme\"</td><td>0:30</td></tr><tr><td>51.</td><td>\"Horse Race\"</td><td>0:46</td></tr><tr><td>52.</td><td>\"Horse Race Goal\"</td><td>0:05</td></tr><tr><td>53.</td><td>\"Ingo's Theme\"</td><td>0:39</td></tr><tr><td>54.</td><td>\"Escape from LonLon Ranch\"</td><td>0:09</td></tr><tr><td>55.</td><td>\"Kakariko Village Orchestra Ver.\"</td><td>1:44</td></tr><tr><td>56.</td><td>\"Ocarina \"Song of Storms\"\"</td><td>0:07</td></tr><tr><td>57.</td><td>\"Windmill Hut\"</td><td>0:52</td></tr><tr><td>58.</td><td>\"Minuet of Woods\"</td><td>0:17</td></tr><tr><td>59.</td><td>\"Forest Temple\"</td><td>1:52</td></tr><tr><td>60.</td><td>\"Bolero of Fire\"</td><td>0:20</td></tr><tr><td>61.</td><td>\"Fire Temple\"</td><td>0:42</td></tr><tr><td>62.</td><td>\"Ice Cavern\"</td><td>0:45</td></tr><tr><td>63.</td><td>\"Serenade of Water\"</td><td>0:19</td></tr><tr><td>64.</td><td>\"Water Temple\"</td><td>1:44</td></tr><tr><td>65.</td><td>\"Nocturne of Shadow\"</td><td>0:23</td></tr><tr><td>66.</td><td>\"Prelude of Light\"</td><td>0:18</td></tr><tr><td>67.</td><td>\"Shadow Temple\"</td><td>1:45</td></tr><tr><td>68.</td><td>\"Gerudo Valley\"</td><td>1:34</td></tr><tr><td>69.</td><td>\"Spirit Temple\"</td><td>2:57</td></tr><tr><td>70.</td><td>\"Requiem of Spirit\"</td><td>0:24</td></tr><tr><td>71.</td><td>\"Kotake &amp;

A version with updated controls has been released on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Nintendo Wii</a> as part of the <a href=\"/new-play-control/3025-1197\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1197\">New Play Control</a> series.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1158/226702-0722222718.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226702\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1158/226702-0722222718.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226702\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/1158/226702-0722222718.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Olimar's ship and the Onions.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's protagonist is <a href=\"/captain-olimar/3005-704\" data-ref-id=\"3005-704\">Captain Olimar</a>, a resident of the planet <a href=\"/hocotate/3035-510\" data-ref-id=\"3035-510\">Hocotate</a>, and employee of the company Hocotate Freight. Taking a vacation from work, Olimar pilots his beloved ship, the <a href=\"/ss-dolphin/3055-2718\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2718\">S.S. Dolphin</a>, off of Hocotate but is hit by a meteorite, causing his ship to crash land on <a href=\"/planet-of-the-pikmin/3035-2439\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2439\">an unknown planet</a> (possibly <a href=\"/earth/3035-65\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earth</a>).</p><p>When Olimar awakens, he finds his ship has been severely damaged and is missing almost all of its parts. He also finds that the planet has an oxygen-filled atmosphere, which is deadly to his race, and is left with a life support system that can keep him alive for no more than thirty days. He explores the crash site and comes across a strange bulb-like organism which he nicknames an <a href=\"/onion/3055-3009\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3009\">Onion</a>. He appears to wake the Onion from a state of hibernation, at which point it deposits a seed. The seed quickly sprouts, and Olimar pulls the sprout out of the ground to find that it is in fact a strange humanoid creature. He calls the creature a <a href=\"/pikmin/3015-312\" data-ref-id=\"3015-312\">Pikmin</a>, as it bears resemblance to the pikpik carrots of his planet.</p><p>As Olimar sprouts and picks more and more Pikmin he finds they follow him and seem to accept orders from him, viewing him as a leader figure. He soon finds the engine of his ship, which the Pikmin carry back to the Dolphin. With it he is able to launch his rocket and with the help of the Pikmin goes in search of the vital components he needs to repair his ship, and return home to Hocotate.</p><h3>Endings</h3><p>Based on how players perform in the 30 days they are given, they will see one of three endings:</p><ul><li><b>100% Ending</b> - Should players manage to collect all the ship parts in the game Olimar will bid farewell to the Pikmin and take off in the Dolphin, back to his home planet of Hocotate. Onions of many colors can be seem rising off of the surface of the Planet of the Pikmin and when a Bulborb tries to attack the Pikmin he left behind, the Pikmin display what they have learned from Olimar by fighting back at the creature.</li><li><b>Good Ending</b> - Should players collect all the parts that Olimar's ship needs to function he will take off in the Dolphin, back to Hocotate, with the Pikmin below staring after him.</li><li><b>Bad Ending</b> - Should players fail to collect all the parts Olimar's ship needs to function, when Olimar attempts to take off he crash lands again. The Pikmin find his body and carry it back to their Onion which turns him into a Hocotatian-Pikmin hybrid so he is able to live on the planet with them. This ending is considered non-canon.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/879000-pikmin_wii_concept_art0040.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879000\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.868\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/879000-pikmin_wii_concept_art0040.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879000\"><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/879000-pikmin_wii_concept_art0040.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Olimar and the Pikmins.</figcaption></figure><p>Players assume the role of Captain Olimar, and see the game from a top-down, almost isometric view point. They have 30 in-game days to complete the game before Olimar's life support system runs out, with each day lasting 15 minutes. Players choose a level to spend the day in, and from there can explore the world, looking for enemies to kill, and ship parts to collect. Players can also gain more Pikmin by taking special pellets or dead enemies to the Pikmin's Onions.</p><p>Pikmin can be dismissed, either by direct means from the player or getting too far away from Olimar. While dismissed, they stand around aimlessly and do nothing However, should certain items come into range of them when they care in this state, they will go over to it and interact with them.</p><h3>Camera</h3><p>The camera is controlled with the L, R, and Z buttons. L swings the camera to Olimar's back, R zooms in and out, and Z switches from an isometric to completely top-down viewpoint. This gives the player a range of viewpoints to play the game from. Shigeru Miyamoto commented that he was against the top-down view, arguing that it turned the Pikmin into mere playing pieces rather than individual beings. While he acknowledged that the top-down view makes the game easier, he encourages players to use a more close-up view, such as the default camera angle.</p><h3>Main Control</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12227/262868-pik_c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262868\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12227/262868-pik_c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-262868\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/12227/262868-pik_c.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_small/1/12227/262868-pik_c.jpg\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>Players control a small marker on the ground which can be moved using the control sticks, and as the marker moves away from Olimar, Olimar will start moving in that direction.</p><p>The A button is used to throw any nearby Pikmin to wherever the marker is. Pikmin can be thrown onto enemies to make them attack them or near objects to make them pick them up.</p><p>The B button controls the whistle, which starts out with a small radius and expands the longer the button is held down. Any Pikmin within that radius will stop whatever they're doing and come back to Olimar's side, whether they are dismissed, attacking, carrying something, etc.</p><p>The Y button brings up the in-game menu, it shows the amount of Pikmin at Olimar's side, and back at the Onion, and shows a map of the area (with stars representing ship parts) once the Radar ship part is obtained.</p><p>The X button will dismiss any Pikmin currently following Olimar.</p><p>The D-pad only has one function. When down on the D-Pad is pressed Olimar will lay down, causing nearby Pikmin to pick him up and carry him to their Onion. Once there the Onion will try to suck him and he bounces off when he hits the Onion and falls back to the ground, as fireworks emanate from the Onion's flower. This has no specific function and is simply an easter egg.</p><h3>Pikmin Variants</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1158/226665-0722222226.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226665\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1158/226665-0722222226.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226665\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/1158/226665-0722222226.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/1158/226665-0722222226.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Three different colors of Pikmin standing around Olimar.</figcaption></figure><p>There are three types of Pikmin in this game, each with their own unique abilities.</p><ul><li><strong>Red</strong> - Resistant to fire, and the strongest when it comes to dealing damage.</li><li><strong>Yellow</strong> - The weakest, but are resistant to electricity. They are lighter than the other Pikmin and therefore can be thrown higher, into areas other Pikmin cannot reach. They can also carry Bomb-Rocks which are special rocks that can explode and destroy certain obstacles.</li><li><strong>Blue</strong> - Can go into water without drowning due to their single gill. Mid-tier strength.</li></ul><p>The Pikmin also have different stages, including Leaf, Bud and Flower. With each stage they increase in swiftness and are able to carry back food and ship pieces faster.</p><h3>Challenge Mode</h3><p>The game includes a Challenge Mode where players can try and sprout as many Pikmin as possible before the day ends. This mode features longer days, and enemies that appear in locations where they would not normally appear during the story mode. Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that the mode be included as a way of introducing a casual play option for players.</p><h2>Locations</h2><h3>The Impact Site</h3><p>The Impact Site is where Olimar's ship first crashed. It was here that he first met the red Pikmin. The Impact Site is the least hostile environment in the game, having few enemies. There are many available pellets, and the region is good for building up the Pikmin's numbers.</p><h3>The Forest of Hope</h3><p>The Forest of Hope is the next region that Olimar is able to visit, and is where yellow Pikmin are first found. The forest is home to hostile beasts, most notably Spotty Bulborbs. The Forest of Hope is a fairly open level, and contains features such as empty cans and a cardboard box to give the sense of a backyard-like environment.</p><h3>The Forest Navel</h3><p>The Forest Navel is a large, dim region, where blue Pikmin are first found. As its name implies, it lies in the heart of a large forest. The level features some of the more bizarre fauna on the Pikmin Planet, such as the Fiery Blowhog and Puffstool. The Forest Navel was created to challenge players to carry ship parts across large distances.</p><h3>The Distant Spring</h3><p>The Distant Spring is a land covered mostly in water. Therefore, blue pikmin become particularly important in locating ship parts. The level contains many dangerous enemies such as Yellow Wollywogs and Spotty Bulbears, a fact that is made worse by roaming distractions such as Swooping Snitchbugs and Puffy Blowhogs. A notable feature of this region is its puzzle elements, most notable in the paths to the Chronos Reactor and UV Lamp. The game's creators wanted to focus more on multi-tasking than puzzles, but chose to leave these few elements in.</p><h3>The Final Trial</h3><p>The Final Trial, as the name implies, is the final region visited by Captain Olimar in his quest to repair his ship. The central feature of the level is Emperor Bulblax, the sole enemy of the level, who holds the final ship part. The rest of the level consists of hazards, requiring all three types of Pikmin to clear the way to the final battle.</p><h2>Ship Parts</h2><p>This is a full list of all 30 parts of the Dolphin, where they can be found, how many Pikmin are needed to carry it and if they are necessary or not.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Mandatory</th><th>Min.</th><th>Max.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Main Engine</td><td>The Impact Site</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Positron Generator</td><td>The Impact Site</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Eternal Fuel Dynamo</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>Yes</td><td>40</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Whimsical Radar</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Extraordinary Bolt</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>Yes</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Nova Blaster</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>No</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Shock Absorber</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>Yes</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Radiation Canopy</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>Yes</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Geiger Counter</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>Yes</td><td>15</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Sagittarius</td><td>The Forest of Hope</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td><i>#</i>1 Ionium Jet</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>15</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Gravity Jumper</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>25</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Automatic Gear</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>15</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Space Float</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>No</td><td>25</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-Dioxin Filter</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>40</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Libra</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>15</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Analog Computer</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Omega Stabilizer</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Guard Satellite</td><td>The Forest Naval</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Repair-Type Bolt</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Massage Machine</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>No</td><td>20</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Interstellar Radio</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Gluon Drive</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>50</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>UV Lamp</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>No</td><td>10</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Zirconium Rotor</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Pilot's Seat</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>25</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Bowsprit</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Chronos Reactor</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td><i>#2</i> Ionium Jet</td><td>The Distant Spring</td><td>Yes</td><td>15</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Secret Safe</td><td>The Final Trial</td><td>No</td><td>40</td><td>95</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>New Play Control Version</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/879016-pikmin_wii_newplaycontrol00016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879016\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.556\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/879016-pikmin_wii_newplaycontrol00016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-879016\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/879016-pikmin_wii_newplaycontrol00016.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/879016-pikmin_wii_newplaycontrol00016.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The 'New Player Control' Pikmin controls.</figcaption></figure><p>Pikmin, along with it's sequel Pikmin 2, was released as part of the '<a href=\"/new-play-control/3025-1197\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1197\">New Play Control</a>' franchise created by Nintendo to rehash Gamecube games to include Wii controls for re-release on the Nintendo Wii.

The existing characters were all given a facelift using a new art style. New \"Z-Missions\" were added as well, along with a side narrative featuring <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9921\" href=\"/nozomi-weaver/3005-9921\" slug=\"nozomi-weaver\">Nozomi Weaver</a>, a new character that like original protagonist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1511\" href=\"/derek-stiles/3005-1511\" slug=\"derek-stiles\">Derek Stiles</a> has the powers of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2862\" href=\"/healing-touch/3015-2862\" slug=\"healing-touch\">Healing Touch</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in Trauma Center: Second Opinion is very similar to it's predecessor Trauma Center: Under the Knife. The game uses the features of the Wii Remote and Nunchuck in place of the stylus-based gameplay of the DS game. The Wii Remote is used to carry out actions on screen such as making incisions, draining blood pools and suturing, while the analogue stick on the Nunchuck is used to easily switch between the available medical tools. The only major variation in tools is that instead of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1511\" href=\"/derek-stiles/3005-1511\" slug=\"derek-stiles\">Derek</a> using his hand to massage a flatlining heart, there is a defibrillator that makes use of the wii's motion controls.</p><p>As in the original game, it is the player's job as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1511\" href=\"/derek-stiles/3005-1511\" slug=\"derek-stiles\">Derek Stiles</a> to save the lives of patients by performing operations. Standard operations seen early in the game include the removal of tumors and mending severe lacerations. As the plot progresses, the player is faced with several strains of Gangliated Utrophin Immuno Latency Toxin, or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5371\" href=\"/guilt/3015-5371\" slug=\"guilt\">GUILT</a>, a terrorist made viral infection.</p><h2>Changes and Alterations</h2><p>In remaking Under the Knife for the Wii, numerous changes were made to the game's presentation and gameplay. Some of these changes include:</p><ul><li>Multiple difficulty levels, replacing Under the Knife's single difficulty level.</li><li>The inclusion of a defibrillator, used by holding the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in a way that simulates the device's shock paddles.</li><li>Applying membranes to tumor extraction points no longer requires massaging the membrane after applying antibiotic gel.</li><li>The game's art style was given a new direction, replacing the manga style of Under the Knife with more realistic character designs. This new art direction has become the norm for the Trauma Center series.</li><li>The inclusion of a new side story that focuses on a new doctor, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9921\" href=\"/nozomi-weaver/3005-9921\" slug=\"nozomi-weaver\">Nozomi Weaver</a>.

In this adventure, the hero - named Sumo is the Japanese version - must stop the evil Dark Lord and wizard Julius attaining immortality by touching the Tree of Mana. Several Final Fantasy themes and characters appear in this game, such as Chocobos, which are not present in the rest of the <a href=\"/world-of-mana/3025-663\" data-ref-id=\"3025-663\">Mana</a> series.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The player plays the role of a male gladiator, forced to fight daily for the pleasure of the Dark Lord of the Glaive Empire. On his deathbed, the hero's friend Willy beseeches the hero to contact the Gemma Knight Bogard to protect Mana from the Dark Lord. With this quest, the hero proceeds to break out of the castle, only to run into the Dark Lord consulting with the mysterious wizard Julius. Julius reveals that a (player-named in the US, Fuji in Japan) girl is the key for traveling up the waterfalls to the temple of the Mana Tree. When Julius leaves, the hero is discovered by the Dark Lord, who chases the hero to a cliff and knocks the hero off a waterfall, presumably to his death.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-484456\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/484456-2.jpg.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 160px\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/484456-2.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-484456\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/931/484456-2.jpg.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The player visiting the town of Topple.</figcaption></figure><p>Upon recovering from his fall, the hero awakens on the outskirts of the town Topple. While adventuring, the hero will run into a fallen warrior, Hasim, being tended to by a girl. Hasim will ask the hero to take the girl to Wendel and to find Bogard. After this, Hasim passes away, and the girl decides to accompany the hero. From the townspeople of Topple, the hero learns that there is a weird old man (Bogard) who lives by the Waterfalls.</p><p>With the girl in tow, the hero then goes to the old man, who reveals that he is indeed Bogard, the Gemma Knight. He reveals that he fought to protect the Mana Tree from the Vandole Empire that sought to use the power of Mana previously to take over the world. He gives the hero a Mattock, and directs him to go through the a cave to the town of Wendel to see Cibba.</p><p>Passing through the swamp on the other side of the cave, the hero and the girl will arrive at Kett's House. The butler invites the hero and the girl to spend the night, but that he can't use the door behind him as it is reserved for Mr. Lee. During the night spent in the house, the girl will teach the hero the Cure spell. However, in the morning the girl will have disappeared, and the butler claims that he has not seen her. A fellow visitor at Kett's House will advise the hero that the Mystic Mirror, hidden in the Marsh cave reveals people's true colors. To gain entrance into the Marsh cave, the hero must first kill the lizardmen that protect the Bronze key.</p><p>After acquiring the Bronze key, the hero can enter the Marsh Cave. Upon entering, he meets a man who tells the hero that many women have gone missing from Kett's House, and that they must be kept in the caskets in the basement of the House. The man will accompany the hero while he explores the cave, ending in a battle with a two-headed dragon in a lake. Upon defeating the Hydra, the hero receives the Mirror as well as Fire magic. The Man will then disappear.</p><p>Upon returning to Kett's and showing the mirror to the butler, the butler will transform into a wolf man. After defeating the butler, the hero can enter the door that he was guarding, revealing another dungeon to traverse. At the end, the hero will find the Chain Flail, which is necessary to cross small gaps, and rescue the girl. When he returns to the entrance, he runs into Mr. Lee, who is a vampire. Upon defeating Mr. Lee, the hero will learn Sleep magic. Then the hero and the girl are free to head to Wendel.</p><p>In Wendel, the hero and the girl will run into the Man who helped in the Marsh Cave. When they arrive at the Wendel Temple, the hero and the girl will finally meet Cibba. Cibba will instruct the girl to step forward onto the symbol, and suddenly the girl's mother will appear. Cibba will tell the player that the girl's mother was the one who helped Bogard and Cibba during the war with Vandole. The girl's mother will reveal to the girl that her family is the Mana Family, and they are the seeds of the Mana Tree (literally). The mother will then ask the girl to protect the Mana Tree, and to protect her pendant, which sealed the waterfalls that lead to the Mana Temple. Right then, the man from the Marsh Cave will rush in to say that Wendel is under attack, and takes the girl presumably to safety. The hero goes to follow, but finds the man to actually be Julius in disguise. Julius reveals that he only helped the hero because he wasn't sure that the girl was actually a member of he Mana family. Julius will then knock out the hero.</p><p>When the hero awakes, Cibba will tell the hero that Julius took the girl west in his airship. The hero pledges to rescue her, and Cibba teaches him Heal magic. The hero will discover that he will need to cross through the Gaia cave, but the cave spits him out, and informs him that he should not walk in its mouth. Upon talking with some local dwarves, the hero disovers that the Gaia cave likes the taste of silver, so the hero heads out to find silver. He heads to an old silver Mine, where he meets the dwarf Watts, who accompanies him in the dungeon. The dungeon concludes with a battle with the Megapede, which upon defeat will yield the hero silver. Watts takes the silver and forges armor and a sword of silver, which the hero must buy to continue.</p><p>Gaia will now let the hero pass, and after passing through Gaia, Bogard will appear and join the hero. Bogard will inform the hero that Julius' airship is refueling at a lake up north. Together they board the airship, and just as the airship takes off, they find the girl in a locked room. Bogard stays to guard the girl while the hero travels around to the side of the airship to rescue her through a window. The girl gives the hero her pendant, but Julius uses fire magic to knock the hero off the airship.</p><p>The hero crash-lands in a house below, and is knocked unconscious. Fortunately, the hero crashes into the house of a former gladiator named Amanda, who was present at the beginning of his adventure. Unfortunately, Amanda takes the pendant and disappears. When the hero reawakens, he discovers that he is in the town of Menos. The townspeople inform him that there are Chocobos in the forest up north, and that Amanda has a brother named Lester, who plays the harp in the town of Jadd, also to the north.</p><p>First the hero heads for the forest, where he finds a Chocobo egg, which hatches. The newborn Chocobo will become the new party member, allowing the hero to ride him around. With the Chocobo in tow, the hero heads to Jadd.</p><p>Jadd is in bad shape, and is run by a man named Davias. Davias is the sun of Medusa, and has the ability to change people into animals. Upon questioning Davias about Amanda, he informs the hero that she is off to the Cave of Oasis, to get a tear from Medusa. The tear will break Davias' curse. By trading a bag of Fang with a boy in town, the hero learns the way into the Cave of Oasis: \"Palm trees... and 8. Got it?\" (the hero must walk a figure 8 around two palm trees to reveal the entrance).</p><p>Once inside the cave, the hero meets up with Amanda, who tells the hero that she took the hero's pendant to give to Davias in exchange for her brother. Instead, Davias cursed her brother and turned him into a bird. Together they explore the Cave of Oasis, where the hero learns Ice magic, and find Medusa's lair. After defeating Medusa, she laughs, yielding no tears. However, during the course of the battle, Medusa bit Amanda, which curses her to turn into Medusa. As she starts the transformation, she begs the hero to take her tears and cure Lester, and kill her. The hero does, and returns to Jadd, rescuing Lester. Lester asks the hero to help him avenge his sister's death by killing Davias. Together they take out Davias, but Davias reveals that the Pendant is already en route to Glaive.</p><p>To repay the hero, Lester clears out the poison gas blocking the way with his harp and teaches the hero Mute magic. With his Chocobo in tow, the hero heads north to Mt. Rocks cave, where he must battle the Metal Crab boss. After the cave, the hero must traverse Mt. Rocks, where he does battle with a Cyclops boss and the Golem boss. Upon defeating the Golem, the hero learns Lit (Lightning) magic. After that the hero finds himself where he started, outside Glaive castle.</p><p>In the Glaive castle, the hero battles a Chimera. After defeating the Chimera, the hero finds the girl in a prison cell and releases her. With the girl in tow, traverses the castle to reach the top, where the Dark Lord is waiting. The hero defeats the Dark Lord alone. Meanwhile Julius hypnotizes the girl, and the hero witnesses her reversing the waterfall so that Julius can go to the Mana Temple. Julius reveals that he is the last man of the Vandole Empire, and desires the power of Mana. To stop the hero from pursuing, Julius knocks him off the waterfall, again.</p><p>This time, the hero lands in a crystalline desert, where his Chocobo rescues him. Unfortunately the Chocobo is injured in the process. However, upon waking up, the player finds an injured Bogard, who was thrown from Julius' airship. The hero discovers that he is in the town of Ish, a city built near the ruins of the Vandole Empire. Bogard is gravely injured, and the hero is claimed to be the last chance for the world. The hero finds his Chocobo being treated by Dr. Bowow, who mechanizes its legs, turning it into Chocobot. With Chocobot, the hero can now traverse water. When the hero goes back to talk to Bogard, he learns that Julius already has the power of Mana, and that the only way to defeat him is with the sword Excalibur. Bogard tells the hero to go find Cibba, who knows where the sword is hidden.</p><p>The hero travels back to Wendel, only to find that Cibba has left town to help with the town of Lorim, which is under attack by monsters. The hero travels to Lorim, only to find that everyone but the King in town has been frozen by the monster Kary, and Cibba is trapped in a room blocked by ice. The hero heads off to the Snowfields Cave, and takes on Kary. After defeating Kary, the hero heads back to Lorim to talk to Cibba. Cibba tells the hero that the legendary sword is hidden in the cave in the Floatrocks, and gives him the key. In the cave, the hero will fight the Kraken. After defeating the Kraken, the hero explores the Undersea Volcano, where he defeats the Iflyte for a rusty sword. Upon presenting the rusty sword to Cibba, he informs the player that they need to resurface the Dime tower, a tower from the Vandole empire, using the rusty sword.</p><p>The hero goes to talk to Dr. Bowow, who reveals that Nuke magic is needed. The hero travels to the Palmy Desert Cave, where he battles the Lich for the Nuke magic. Now equipped with the Nuke magic, Dr. Bowow will reveal the location of the Cave of Ruins. Using the Nuke magic to blow the entrance open, the hero traverses the cave of ruin and fights the Mantis Ant. On a pedestal in the Cave of Ruins surrounded by waterfalls, the hero releases the power of the rusty sword, which rises the Dime tower from where it sank into the desert.</p><p>Dime tower is the hero's next destination, where he meets Marcie, a robot designed by Dr. Bowow 50 years ago. With Marcie, the hero will climb Dime tower, where the hero will learn that Julius is the last hope of the Vandole Empire, and that he is the last chance to stop Julius. At the top of the tower, the hero fights Garuda, whose defeat destabilizes the tower. To escape, Marcie throws the hero to safety, sinking with the tower back into the sand.</p><p>Now the hero is ready to return to Glaive castle, and take the reversed waterfall to the temple of Mana. The Mana Temple challenges the hero with three boss fights: the Dragon, the Red Dragon, and the Dragon Zombie (the zombified two-headed dragon from the Marsh cave). After defeating the Dragon Zombie, the hero will run into the girl's mother, who will congratulate the hero on becoming a great Gemma Knight and will bestow the hero with Excalibur.</p><p>The hero now faces Julius, who is empowered by the Power of Mana, and reveals his plans to create a Neo-Vandole Empire. After fighting Julius three times, the hero finally grasps defeat, only to find that the Tree of Mana is dying. The girl's mother reappears, and reveals to the hero and the girl that she was the Tree, and only the girl can become the new tree. The girl is left with the decision on whether she wants to become the next Tree of Mana, and she agrees. The hero agrees to be the Tree's protector, to remain close to the girl.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>This game retains the top-down camera-view and active battle system of the original Legend of Zelda. The hero attacks with a variety of weapons (such as swords sickles and axes), and a strong attack is possible if the gauge at the bottom of the screen is filled by waiting between attacks. Enemies In addition, the hero can learn a predetermined set of spells (8 in all) to assist him in his journey.

One was developed and published by <a href=\"/virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc/3010-176\" data-ref-id=\"3010-176\">Virgin Interactive</a> and the other by <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a>. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> - and much later the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color</a> and DOS and <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a> home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.</p><p>In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.</p><p>The third game was made by <a href=\"/sega/3010-62\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> for the <a href=\"/game-gear/3045-5\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Game Gear</a> and <a href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Master System</a>.

The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p>Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, \"What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed!

If a player was lucky enough to achieve this, the game would simultaneously trigger the spawning of a Diablo \"clone\".

Diablo Clone can spawn almost everywhere where a <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">mini boss</a> is (e.g Rakanishu in Stony Field). Keeping Annihilus in the inventory grants a permanent +1 to all skills, attributes, and resistances which varies from 10 to 20.

The charm also introduced people to the \"Pandemonium Event\". This event is difficult to trigger owing to the requirement of specific items needed for its completion. First off you will need three <a href=\"/key/3055-105\" data-ref-id=\"3055-105\">keys</a> dropped from various <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">mini bosses</a> throughout the game.

This boss will drop one of the three organs you will need (<a href=\"/diablo/3005-849\" data-ref-id=\"3005-849\">Diablo's</a> Horn, <a href=\"/baal/3005-1349\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1349\">Baal's</a> Eye and <a href=\"/mephisto/3005-1731\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1731\">Mephisto's</a> Brain) to trigger access to a zone called \"Uber Tristram\". Uber Tristram was intended only for the strongest players, since it pitted players against all the hardest bosses in the game at once, now in \"Uber\" form: Uber Diablo, Uber Baal and Uber Mephisto. Not only that but you will also have spawning minions around you. If you can take all of the bosses you will get this unique charm. The Hellfire Torch have a permanent 3-to all (random character class skill) and also <a href=\"/attributes/3015-1681\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\">attributes</a> and resistance which varies from 10 to 20. The Torch also got 8 to light radius, 10 charges on level 30 Hyrda and a 25% chance to cast level 10 Firestorm on striking (Nerfed to a 5% chance to cast with the patch 1.13). The concept of hunting for keys to open a portal to more difficult versions of the game's bosses was carried over into <a href=\"/diablo-iii/3030-20803\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">Diablo III</a>, where players can hunt keywardens in order to use the Infernal Machine, a system which generates fights with Uber versions of King Leoric, Maghda, Siegebreaker, Zoltan Kulle, Rakanoth, Ghom, Diablo and more in the hopes of finding crafting materials required for extremely powerful legendary jewellery.</p><h4>Gheed's Fortune</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719128-g-z02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719128\" style=\"width: 340px\" data-ratio=\"0.57352941176471\" data-width=\"340\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719128-g-z02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719128\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130632/2719128-g-z02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130632/2719128-g-z02.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Gheed's Fortune Grand Charm</figcaption></figure><p>Also introduced in patch 1.10 and first ladder season.

The patch was delayed due to an exploit experienced in Blizzard's sister title, <a href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\">WarCraft 3</a> in which custom maps can be loaded with malware and distributed via a custom map. The Diablo \"legacy\" team had to swap out from working on 1.13 and help fix this major exploit. This has caused an uproar in the Diablo II community because a ladder reset was announced for before the 1.13 patch was to be released. Blizzard made the announcement because the patch was \"imminent\" but they were blind-sided by the WarCraft 3 issue.</p><p>The new 1.13 patch was to hit the Public Testing Realm in July 2009 according to a post made by Bashiok, a community manager for Blizzard. The patch was to include an increase in stash size and other changes as suggested by players on the official Diablo 2 forums.</p><p>This patch is now live on public testing realms awaiting further testing. Anyone can access this test server to try out the additions and changes. The increased stash size had to be removed as it threatened to undo the very game itself if they added an increased stash size. The game has however gained the ability to respec characters as well as some new bonus content and a few tweaks and balances.</p><p>The new 1.13 patch has now gone live. As of March 23rd, 2010 the Ladder has now been reset, sending all Ladder characters from before the patch to non-Ladder status.</p><h2>Patch 1.13</h2><p>Here are the changes introduced by the new patch:</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719131\" style=\"width: 316px\" data-ratio=\"0.73417721518987\" data-width=\"316\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2719131\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130632/2719131-token_of_absolution_%28diablo_ii%29.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The Token of Absolution allows players to respec</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A new mystery has been revealed</strong> within Diablo's bosses you will now have a chance to find essence which you can transmute in your cube to make a token which again you can use to respec your characters attributes and skills.

long-running Pok\u00e9mon franchise. Developed by Game Freak, Red and Blue were the studio's first major successes. The company would eventually go on to create several direct sequels to the games for Nintendo's portable consoles that followed the Game Boy.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The basic premise of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue involves a nameable protagonist who sets off on a journey to thoroughly train, catch, trade, and ultimately master as many Pok\u00e9mon as he can. After acquiring one of three Pok\u00e9mon from Professor Oak; Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander, and then fighting a subsequent training battle with his rival, the main character sets off to explore the world to fulfill his goals. In order to achieve ultimate success, he must use his Pok\u00e9mon team to fight and defeat eight Gym Leaders, specialists who each deal in a specific type of Pok\u00e9mon, as well as the Elite Four and Gary Oak. Only after all of that has been achieved does the story technically end.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3957/203263-pokemon_blue_version_gbc_screenshot1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203263\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3957/203263-pokemon_blue_version_gbc_screenshot1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-203263\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3957/203263-pokemon_blue_version_gbc_screenshot1.gif\"/></a><figcaption>Blue's title screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Most Pok\u00e9mon are acquired by \"catching\" them while they are still out and about in the wild. They can be found by the player simply roaming about in the Pok\u00e9mons' native habitats, which usually happens by walking around in grass, swimming around in a body of water, or in other similar instances. Once a battle has been initiated, it is up to the player to weaken the wild Pok\u00e9mon's Hit Points (HP) enough so that they can throw a Pok\u00e9ball at them. Pok\u00e9balls are the containers which hold each trainer's Pok\u00e9mon and as long as the wild Pok\u00e9mon cannot break free from one, it can be freely used by the trainer who owns it. If a trainer's team is full at the time of the capture, the newly acquired Pok\u00e9mon is then sent to a PC for storage and can be retrieved at a later point in time. Captured Pok\u00e9mon can also be given nicknames, although doing so is optional. In the anime this is shown through Ritchie, who also puts stickers on his Pok\u00e9balls to differentiate them.</p><figure style=\"width: 160px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6372/225430-b6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225430\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6372/225430-b6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225430\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6372/225430-b6.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>Pok\u00e9mon is a traditional role-playing game in many facets.</figcaption></figure><p>Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue's battle system consists of gameplay mechanics which are common with many turn-based Japanese RPGs. Up to six Pok\u00e9mon can be a part of a trainer's roster at any time, which is where the game's defining characteristics come into play.</p><p>Since each Pok\u00e9mon can have a different type (Grass-type, Water-type, Fire-type, Normal-type, Flying-type, Electric-type, Ground-type, Rock-type, Ice-type, Psychic-type, Bug-type, Fighting-type, Poison-type, Ghost-type) a system of strengths and weakness is employed, in addition to the standard calculations based on their individual statistics. Every attack is also assigned a type, which is also taken into consideration during battle.</p><p>Although most Pok\u00e9mon have limitations regarding which attacks they can learn, they are allowed to learn some which aren't the same as their type. No attack can be used an infinite number of times, though, as the amount of usage is dependent upon the amount of Power Points (PP) each attack has. These Power Points can be restored either through the use of specific items or by visiting a Pok\u00e9mon Center, which is also used to fully heal a trainer's current roster of Pok\u00e9mon.</p><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/238964-pokemon_yellow_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238964\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.89971346704871\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/238964-pokemon_yellow_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238964\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/238964-pokemon_yellow_gameplay.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/238964-pokemon_yellow_gameplay.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Typical battle scene</figcaption></figure><p>As the Pok\u00e9mon enter into battles and continue to win them, they gain experience points. Once they accumulate a specified amount, they level up, which serves two purposes. Leveling up the Pok\u00e9mon in Red and Blue allows most Pok\u00e9mon to learn new attacks which can be added to their arsenal, in addition to raising their individual statistics.</p><p>However, because each Pok\u00e9mon is limited to four different attacks, considerations must be made as they reach progressively higher levels. Leveling up also allows most Pok\u00e9mon to evolve, enabling them to become a new species. The point at which each Pok\u00e9mon may evolve is different depending on the species, although the trainer is allowed to prevent a Pok\u00e9mon from doing so if they desire. One such advantage which comes from canceling an evolution is that more advanced and powerful attacks can be learned earlier if the Pok\u00e9mon doesn't evolve, assuming the attack can still be learned in an evolved form.</p><figure style=\"width: 160px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/608/367990-pokemon_blue_65.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367990\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/608/367990-pokemon_blue_65.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367990\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/608/367990-pokemon_blue_65.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/608/367990-pokemon_blue_65.png\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>With Pok\u00e9mon, though, it is not always possible to evolve them via leveling up. In those instances, special stones can be given to the Pok\u00e9mon to force them to evolve. The most famous Pok\u00e9mon in the Red and Blue versions which are able to do this include <a href=\"/pikachu/3005-145\" data-ref-id=\"3005-145\">Pikachu</a>, Jigglypuff, and <a href=\"/eevee/3015-2004\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2004\">Eevee</a>, the latter of which has multiple evolutions depending on the stone applied. Some Pok\u00e9mon still do not evolve in this manner, however, which is elaborated upon below.</p><p>Outside of battling, one of the defining traits of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue is its trading feature. Because Red and Blue each have Pok\u00e9mon which are exclusive to their individual versions, collecting all of the Pok\u00e9mon requires trading with someone who owns the alternative version. Trading is done by connecting the two <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boys</a> via a link cable. Each person then decides which Pok\u00e9mon they wish to trade and the duo's choices are transferred. With a few very specific Pok\u00e9mon, the trading process allows them to evolve once the switching is complete. Although traded Pok\u00e9mon are under the command of their new trainer, they still carry identification which indicates who originally had them.</p><p>Two linked Game Boys can also be used by trainers to battle one another. The majority of the rules which govern battle in the single-player game remain the same, although items cannot be used in linked battles. Skirmishes are otherwise the same, with a winner being declared once one trainer's entire team of Pok\u00e9mon has fainted.</p><h2>Pok\u00e9mon

HIs choice will depend on the player's, whatever Pok\u00e9mon the player chooses, he will choose the Pok\u00e9mon with a stronger type against the player's. For example, if the player chooses Bulbasaur he will choose Charmander because fire is naturally strong against grass. Here are the three sets of Pok\u00e9mon he might be using depending on the last evolution of the Pok\u00e9mon he chose at the lab in the beginning of the game:</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Gary's Starting Pokemon</th><th>Other Pokemon in Line Up</th></tr><tr><td>With <a href=\"/venusaur/3015-1038\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1038\">Venusaur</a></td><td><ul><li><a href=\"/pidgeot/3015-1041\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1041\">Pidgeot</a></li><li><a href=\"/alakazam/3015-1939\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1939\">Alakazam</a></li><li><a href=\"/rhydon/3015-2152\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2152\">Rhydon</a></li><li><a href=\"/arcanine/3015-1833\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1833\">Arcanine</a></li><li><a href=\"/gyarados/3015-2000\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2000\">Gyarados</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>With <a href=\"/blastoise/3015-1130\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1130\">Blastoise</a></td><td><ul><li><a href=\"/pidgeot/3015-1041\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1041\">Pidgeot</a></li><li><a href=\"/alakazam/3015-1939\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1939\">Alakazam</a></li><li><a href=\"/rhydon/3015-2152\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2152\">Rhydon</a></li><li><a href=\"/exeggutor/3015-1986\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1986\">Exeggutor</a></li><li><a href=\"/arcanine/3015-1833\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1833\">Arcanine</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>With <a href=\"/charizard/3015-1023\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1023\">Charizard</a></td><td><ul><li><a href=\"/pidgeot/3015-1041\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1041\">Pidgeot</a></li><li><a href=\"/alakazam/3015-1939\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1939\">Alakazam</a></li><li><a href=\"/rhydon/3015-2152\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2152\">Rhydon</a></li><li><a href=\"/gyarados/3015-2000\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2000\">Gyarados</a></li><li><a href=\"/exeggutor/3015-1986\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1986\">Exeggutor</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Glitches</h2><h3>MissingNo.</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2776160\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95666/2776160-oie_overlay.gif\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 160px\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95666/2776160-oie_overlay.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2776160\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/95666/2776160-oie_overlay.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/95666/2776160-oie_overlay.gif\"/></noscript></a></figure><p>MissingNo.; Easily the most famous Pok\u00e9mon <a href=\"/glitch/3015-511\" data-ref-id=\"3015-511\">glitch</a> of all time. <a href=\"/missingno/3005-871\" data-ref-id=\"3005-871\">MissingNo.</a> is a buggy Pok\u00e9mon which, if caught, can make all kinds of strange things happen in the game.</p><p>To catch a MissingNo. is a very simple process. In <a href=\"/viridian-city/3035-208\" data-ref-id=\"3035-208\">Viridian City</a>, talk to the old man who teaches how to catch Pok\u00e9mon. Talk to him three times and when he asks the player if he wants to learn to catch Pok\u00e9mon, the player must select 'no' the first two times and then say 'yes' the third. After watching him catch a <a href=\"/weedle/3015-1040\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1040\">Weedle</a>, fly to <a href=\"/cinnabar-island/3035-1583\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1583\">Cinnabar Island</a> and surf along the right edge of the island and don't leave the edge. Once a Pok\u00e9mon battle happens, the player can run into a MissingNo. or one of the glitched Pok\u00e9mon over level 100.</p><p>Some strange things will happen to the game when the player catches a MissingNo.. The item in the sixth slot will be duplicated to over 99. Also, battle history with the Elite Four is completely glitched. If MissingNo gains one level the he will evolve into a level 1 Kangaskhan. If the player catches MissingNo. then it can effect the game cartridge by altering the text to gibberish when checking Pok\u00e9mon in the elite four.</p><h3>Duplicating Pokemon</h3><p>This is a trick that many players would do send a good Pok\u00e9mon to a friend and still be able to keep the Pok\u00e9mon to play with for themselves. To do this trick the player needs to find a Pok\u00e9mon that the player wants to duplicate for whomever the player is trading to and the recipient must get a Pok\u00e9mon they are willing to lose. Start a trade like normal but on the Game Boy that is trading the good Pok\u00e9mon switch it off before it says trade complete on the screen, on the other players game it will come up with the usual message and they will have the desired Pokemon.</p><h3>The Invisible PC</h3><p>In Celedon City, there is a hotel in the bottom right-hand corner of the city. When Red is in the hotel he needs to go all the way to the right and go as far north as he can, take two steps back and one forward and then he will be able to access a PC out of thin air!</p><h2>Misconceptions &amp; Rumors</h2><h3>Pok\u00e9Gods</h3><p>Along with MissingNo. there were always rumors about such Pok\u00e9mon called Pok\u00e9Gods. These Pok\u00e9mon were believed to be obtainable in many ways, but were never true.</p><p>One such rumored way of getting these Pok\u00e9mon was to get access to Bill's Garden, which was supposed to be a secret place behind Bill's house where powerful Pok\u00e9mon resided. Another rumored way was to get access to the Pok\u00e9Gods City. This was a place that would be accessible to after having beaten the Elite Four 50 times in a row without saving or healing, Professor Oak would saying something like \"I'm getting tired of this\" and let the player roam around the ending area, where a ladder would be located. This is also not true.</p><p>The more viable option was the truck off to the side before getting on the S.S. Ann. This was possible by finding a way to surf before actually boarding the S.S. Ann. In the back of the truck were rumored to be a Mew and a Togepi. Togepi actually turned out to be a real Pok\u00e9mon in <a href=\"/pokemon-goldsilver/3030-8210\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8210\">Silver and Gold</a>. Another Pok\u00e9god that turned out to be real was Pikablu. This Pok\u00e9mon turned out to be <a href=\"/marill/3015-3135\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3135\">Marill</a>, the little blue water Pok\u00e9mon.</p><p>Some of the Pok\u00e9Gods were rumored to have the names listed below (this is only a few of the many Pok\u00e9Gods):</p><ul><li>Charcolt</li><li>Rainer</li><li>Sapusaur</li><li>Locustud</li><li>Mewthree</li><li>Pikablu</li><li>Chrono Mew</li><li>Sandswipes</li><li>Nidogoddess</li></ul><p>Some Pok\u00e9Gods were believed to evolve from already fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon using an item called a Mist Stone. However, the Mist Stone was just another false rumor.</p><h2>Pok\u00e9mon Green Version</h2><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/520519-pokemon_green_jap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-520519\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2626262626263\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12541/520519-pokemon_green_jap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-520519\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12541/520519-pokemon_green_jap.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12541/520519-pokemon_green_jap.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Pok\u00e9mon Green</figcaption></figure><p>Although it is commonly believed that the first releases in the Pok\u00e9mon series were Pok\u00e9mon Red and Pok\u00e9mon Blue, the Blue version of the game actually made its debut under a different title and was known as Pok\u00e9mon Green. The games were originally released in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> as \"Pocket Monsters Red\" and \"Pocket Monsters Green\". Due to numerous glitches and bugs in these original versions of the game, such as being able to find Pok\u00e9mon in the wild which were only supposed to be obtainable at certain later stages in the game, they were amended and re-released as the more commonly known Red and Blue versions.</p><p>Many of the sprites were changed and there were also some slight changes to the locations of wild Pok\u00e9mon. These updated versions were later released in <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">America</a> and <a href=\"/europe/3035-289\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe</a>, therefore the Green version was never released outside of Japan. Interestingly enough, when the games were remade and updated for the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> decided to reference the Green version rather than the Blue, and the new games were released as <a href=\"/pokemon-leaf-greenfire-red/3030-14522\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14522\">Pok\u00e9mon FireRed</a> and <a href=\"/pokemon-leaf-greenfire-red/3030-14522\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14522\">LeafGreen</a>.</p><h2>Cartridge Specifics</h2><p>Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue both utilize a CR2025 battery for save data. Various sources on the Internet state that early cartridges used a 2016 battery, and it is possible to replace the existing battery with a CR2032.</p>", "releases": [{"api_detail_url":

It was released on the Super Famicom on April 2, 1994. Six months later, on October 11, 1994, it was released as Final Fantasy III on the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> in North America. Final Fantasy VI was later rereleased on the Sony <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a> (its first European release) and <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>. The Playstation versions added <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">load time pauses before each battle</a>, but it is still a good game despite this flaw. Both of these rereleases were developed by <a href=\"/tose-co-ltd/3010-1417\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1417\">TOSE</a> and published by various publishers.</p><p>Final Fantasy VI is generally considered by fans and critics alike to be one of the best console role-playing games (it has a 94% rating on GameRankings), let alone <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy</a> games, ever made. The game was met with wide critical acclaim, being praised for its varied and complex characters, interesting story, and graphical excellence.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game to not be directed by Final Fantasy creator <a href=\"/hironobu-sakaguchi/3040-633\" data-ref-id=\"3040-633\">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, instead being co-directed by <a href=\"/yoshinori-kitase/3040-634\" data-ref-id=\"3040-634\">Yoshinori Katase</a> and <a href=\"/hiroyuki-itou/3040-16555\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16555\">Hiroyuki Ito</a>. The composer for the game was famed Final Fantasy composer <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. <a href=\"/yoshitaka-amano/3040-639\" data-ref-id=\"3040-639\">Yoshitaka Amano</a> created the character design for the game, which were then converted into sprites (taking small liberties from time to time, such as changing hair color) by the graphic design team headed by <a href=\"/tetsuya-takahashi/3040-16562\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16562\">Tetsuya Takahashi</a> (head graphic designer), <a href=\"/hideo-minaba/3040-45954\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45954\">Hideo Minaba</a> (background graphics), Kazuko Shibuyo (object graphics), and <a href=\"/tetsuya-nomura/3040-637\" data-ref-id=\"3040-637\">Tetsuya Nomura</a> (who designed some characters).</p><p>The game also utilized the Super Nintendo's unique <a href=\"/mode-7/3015-184\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7</a> capabilities. When exploring the map, the world scrolls in a pseudo-3D fashion, common to Mode 7 style graphics.</p><h3>Localization</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/716942-image1067.jpeg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-716942\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 237px\" data-ratio=\"2.5485232067511\" data-width=\"237\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:254.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/716942-image1067.jpeg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-716942\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/716942-image1067.jpeg.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The Japanese version's final battle screens</figcaption></figure><p>When released in North America, Final Fantasy VI had many changes from the original version. First and most noticeable is the name change; from Final Fantasy VI to Final Fantasy III. Despite the name change, the game is now commonly referred to as Final Fantasy VI, as to avoid confusion. There were no major gameplay changes, like previous games in the series, but much of the script was changed. The game's translator, <a href=\"/ted-woolsey/3040-50831\" data-ref-id=\"3040-50831\">Ted Woolsey</a>, said that the Japanese version contained much \"playfulness and sexuality\" that couldn't be carried over due to Nintendo of America's strict guidelines.</p><p>As is common in games, most of the names changed, for a variety of different reasons. Some names were changed because they broke the six character limit (Stragus to Strago), while others were changed to seem more exotic (Tina to Terra). Since the game came out before the ESRB ( <a href=\"/entertainment-software-ratings-board/3010-6476\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6476\">Entertainment Software Ratings Board</a>) was a standard, many changes had to be made due to sexual or violent content. The text files had to be shortened because of the limited space in the cartridge. It took Ted Woolsey only 30 days to complete the translation all by himself.</p><p>Many of the sprites in the Japanese version of the game were bordering on nudity, so these were edited. The woman form of the Chadarnook was edited to cover up more of the skin, as was the Critic, Goddess, and Siren sprites. The sprites used in the final battle also differ; the Japanese version is much larger than the American version.</p><h3>Other Versions</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844491\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.55189873417722\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844491\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VI has been re released in various forms on a variety of systems after its original Super Famicom/SNES release. First, there was a technical demonstration based on the original Final Fantasy VI, called Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game. In the game, players controlled Terra, Locke, and Shadow in various battles by drawing patterns with a mouse, each pattern corresponding to a different move. The game was used to demonstrate the uses of SGI ( Silicon Graphics, Inc.) and a possible graphical direction for Square's next RPG. The technology was later put to use in Final Fantasy VII.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/784212-063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-784212\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.2380952380952\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/784212-063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-784212\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/784212-063.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/784212-063.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Celes Chere in a CG trailer available in the PlayStation version</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VI was also released three separate times for PlayStation: it was included in <a href=\"/final-fantasy-anthology/3030-30783\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30783\">Final Fantasy Anthology</a> (released on October 5, 1999) and <a href=\"/final-fantasy-collection/3030-18707\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18707\">Final Fantasy Collection</a> (released only in Japan on March 11, 1999), and was also released as a standalone title (only in Japan and PAL regions). The game was left relatively unchanged, save for the addition of CG opening and closing cutscenes, and added load times before each of the game's many <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered encounters</a>. Other notable things included were a bestiary and artwork library that were accessible from the title screen. Various other things were added, such as new opening and closing effects to battles, the option to quicksave (although all saving still had to be initiated manually), and bug fixes (as well as new bugs being created). The standalone edition of the game had a limited edition that shipped fifty-thousand copies and came with an alarm clock. Final Fantasy Anthology has an 80% rating on Metacritc and an 85% on GameRankings, gaining it the status of \"generally favorable reviews.\"</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/841249-final_fantasy_vi_advance07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-841249\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 240px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/841249-final_fantasy_vi_advance07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-841249\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/841249-final_fantasy_vi_advance07.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/841249-final_fantasy_vi_advance07.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Title screen of Final Fantasy VI Advance</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VI Advance was released on the Game Boy Advance on November 30, 2006 in Japan, February 5, 2007 in North America, and June 29, 2007 in Europe. This version is more extensively changed than the PlayStation ports, but without the load times before each of the game's many <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered encounters</a>. New gameplay features, redone graphics, and a retranslated script are among the most notable things included. Four new Espers were included in the game (Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar, and Diabolos), as well as two new locations: the Dragons' Den (which included a new boss, the Kaiser Dragon) and the Soul Shrine (in which players could battle enemies continuously). Three new spells are included in the game, and bugs from the original are fixed. A bestiary and music player are also included in the game. In addition, the boxart and game-related art has been redone as well, again by Yoshitaka Amano. One scene, in which Celes is beaten, has been removed from the game, presumably due to events in Japan at the time of release. The game was relatively well-received from both critics and fans alike; it holds a a 92% average rating on Metacritic and a 91% average on GameRankings.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288241\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288241\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>An example of the overworld</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay of Final Fantasy VI is similar to that of its predecessors and of other 16-bit Japanese RPGs. Player characters move about the game\u2019s fictional setting, completing a story-fueled series of objectives: reaching a certain location, defeating a certain enemy, retrieving a certain item, solving a puzzle, figuring out what to do next, etc. The gameplay is often broken up by story and dialogue sequences, which advance the story through generally non-interactive conversations and events. Over the course of the game, the player-controlled party grows to include a handful of unique characters; this group acts as the primary perspective from which players view the unfolding plot. As they battle enemies (which are <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">encountered at random</a> and are unavoidable) these player characters gain EXP (experience points), which allow them to gain levels. Every time a character gains a level, his or her stats (attributes upon which combat capability depends) are raised, allowing the character to fight more powerful enemies more easily.</p><p>There are four main screens in the game.</p><p>In the overworld screen, the player party traverses an expansive land, moving between various locales (towns and dungeons). More parts of the overworld and more locales become accessible as the player makes progress through the game. The party is susceptible to <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered battles</a> in the overworld.</p><p>Towns and dungeons are accessible from the overworld. In this screen, the player party moves about smaller-scale areas, interacting with NPCs and environmental objects. Towns generally include shops and inns, whose goods and services are bought with GP (currency). Towns are populated by numerous NPCs, with which the player can converse. Dungeons are more dangerous, as the party is vulnerable to enemy attacks while exploring them, due to <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered encounters</a>, and no shops or inns are found within. (Although Tents can be used at save points to replenish the party's health and magic, serving the same purpose as an inn.) Often contained in a dungeon is one of many powerful boss enemies, most of which must be fought in the course of the game. Dungeons are usually larger and more complexly designed than towns. Towns and dungeons are the primary settings for cutscenes and plot events.</p><p>In the battle screen, the player controls the party as it fights against an enemy or enemies. The player enters the battle screen when a random or scripted battle is commenced, and exits by winning, fleeing, or losing the battle. (Losing a battle results in a game over, meaning that all the player's progress since their last save point is lost, and the player is sent back to the title screen without even being offered a chance to try that battle again). In battle, the player does not directly control character movement; instead, the player selects battle commands from menus unique to the individual party members.</p><p>The menu screen is accessible from the overworld and town/dungeon screens. Here, the player can use items, manage party members\u2019 equipment and abilities, view their stats, change game settings, and save their progress. (which has to be done manually)</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670302\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670302\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>A typical battle screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VI's battles (which are most often random) utilize the <a href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">Active Time Battle</a> system first implemented in <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a>. Each character has his or her own action gauge, which fills up at a rate dependent on the character's speed stat. When the gauge is full, the character can perform actions chosen from his or her command list. Such actions include performing a basic attack, casting a magic spell, using an item, and drawing upon the unique ability of the character.</p><p>Magic, as in all Final Fantasy games, can be used for a range of purposes. Primarily, spells are used to inflict damage, bestow status conditions (both positive and negative), and heal. To cast a spell, a character must use MP, which can be restored similarly to HP. If a character's current MP is lower than the MP cost of a spell, he or she will be unable to cast it. MP, like HP, is a stat; as it rises, the character's maximum MP count will rise.</p><p>As in many Final Fantasy games, the combat screen is separated into one large rectangle on top, in which all the action takes place, and one smaller one at the bottom of the screen, in which the player inputs commands. Certain non-interactive cutscenes also take place in the combat screen, with characters displayed as battle sprites.</p><p>When the party wins a battle, it gains EXP, GP, and (sometimes) AP (see the \"Equipment\" section below). Defeated enemies sometimes also drop items or equipment.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671528\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671528\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Browsing through items at an item store</figcaption></figure><p>There is a lot of equipment in the game, providing for great lengths of customization. The right hand, left hand, head, and body can all be customized with a wide variety of weapons and armor. Weapons determine the nature of characters' physical attacks, while shields and armor boost their stats (primarily defense and magic defense). Generally, one hand holds a weapon, one hand holds a shield, the head holds headgear, and the body holds body armor. However, the Genji Glove and Gauntlet relics (see below) allow characters to break the rules regarding weapon-equipping.</p><p>Relics are items that have effects less traditional than those of weapons and armor. Two can be equipped at once by each character, allowing them to bestow myriad potential bonus combinations. Examples of relics include the Sniper Sight (which ensures a 100% hit rate of basic attacks), the Black Belt (which grants a 50% chance of counterattacking against enemies' physical strikes), and the Alarm Earring (which prevents back attacks and pincer attacks). Relics can protect against various status conditions, bestow positive status conditions, change the nature of attacks or abilities, and boost stats. There are also relics that offer out-of-battle bonuses; for example, the Sprint Shoes double walking speed in towns and dungeons.</p><p>Espers add a deep customization element to the game's magic system. Although they are not introduced particularly early in the game, they are an essential part of the game's character customization. Espers collected in their Magicite forms are the primary means by which characters learn magic spells. Each one has a unique set of spells, and each spell has a corresponding rate multiplier (a spell's multiplier usually varies between the different Espers that teach it). When a character has equipped an Esper (each character can equip one at a time), battling will further his or her learning of the Esper's spells: the number of AP (ability points) earned at the end of battle is multiplied by each spell's rate multiplier and added to the spell's growth percentage, which represents the character's learning progress. When the character's growth percentage for a spell reaches 100, he or she learns it. When the Esper is unequipped from the character, all its growth percentages (and availability of learned spells) remain; even if a percentage is lower than 100, the character can later continue adding to it by equipping another Esper (or the same Esper) with the given spell.</p><p>Espers also feature as the game's summons. Each equipped Esper can be summoned once per battle to perform its unique spell; these summon spells are generally more powerful than most commonly learned magic. No AP growth is needed to perform summons.</p><p>It should be noted that, due to the workings of the Magicite system, every character in the game (save Gogo and Umaro, who cannot equip Espers) can learn every spell, even though Terra and Celes are the only ones who can learn magic through leveling.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game's story begins 1,000 years in the past during the War of the Magi. Espers had power, and men wanted that. What was necessary to obtain it was to kill the Esper and collect the remains, called Magicite. It was total war, very nearly apocalyptic in its scope. Society needed 1,000 years to return to a semblance of what it was before hand. With the Espers now in self-imposed exile, the war came to a close.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-286858\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-286858\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Terra, Biggs, and Wedge search for an Esper during the opening credits.</figcaption></figure><p>The game opens with Terra, an amnesiac girl aiding the Empire in searching the village of Narshe for an Esper (specifically, the Esper 'Tritoch'). After dispatching a few guards, the group comes upon the Esper. The guards approach it slowly, but Terra reacts strangely to it, killing the guards. When she awakes, she is under the care of an old man who claims to be part of a rebel group known as the Returners. He explains that Terra has been controlled by a Slave Crown, forcing her to do the Empire's bidding. He agrees to assist her, when all of the sudden, Imperial Soldiers come knocking at the door. The old man quickly tells Terra to flee, showing her the back way.</p><p>The player is then introduced to Locke Cole, a cocky, self-assured thief (although he prefers 'treasure hunter'). He aids Terra in the fight against the Imperial Soldiers, as well as enlisting the help of several Moogles. After the battle, Locke vows to protect Terra no matter the cost, and proceeds to do so at the best of his ability. After assisting in protecting Terra from Imperial Soldiers, he is tasked with leading Terra to the hideout of the Returners.</p><p>Along the way, the small party stops at Figaro Castle. There, they are introduced to the \"ladies' man\" Edgar Roni Figaro. Edgar is charming, and attempts in sweet-talking Terra, although she is unlike other women that Edgar has courted, as she seems incapable of love. Edgar is seemingly an ally with the Empire, but in reality he is an essential leader of the Returners. After being introduced to Edgar, Kefka comes in search of Terra. Kefka lies that the girl is \"of no importance\" to the Empire, but everyone present sees past Kefka's ploy.</p><p>Edgar bravely lies, saying that Terra is not in the castle. In response, Kefka sets his castle on fire. As he is laughing manically, the party manages to escape, and then the castle dives beneath the sand (moving over to an area near Kohlingen). Kefka is humiliated and outraged, especially after the party manages to dispatch his Magitek soldiers. The party makes their way to Mt. Koltz, where Sabin Rene Figaro is introduced. Vargas (Duncan's son) attacks the party, due to the fact that he believes his father will give the fighting dojo he owns to Sabin. A brief scene plays out in which Sabin disposes of Vargas, who was intent on murdering Sabin in order to gain the dojo. After a brief reuniting \"ceremony,\" the party sets out once again for the Returners' headquarters.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670288\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670288\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The Returners' headquarters</figcaption></figure><p>Upon reaching the Returners' headquarters, the leader, Banon, requests Terra's assistance in dethroning the Empire. The player is given the choice of whether or not to accept the offer, but either way Terra will end up aiding the Returners. After Terra accepts, a battle plan is laid out. Unfortunately, a Returner bursts and announces that the town of South Figaro has been attacked by Imperial forces. Locke goes to investigate, while the rest of the party escapes on the Lethe River. After a battle with Ultros, however, the party is separated from Sabin, whom is thrown off to an unknown destination.</p><p>The player then has the choice to choose between Locke's scenario, Sabin's scenario, or Edgar and Terra's scenario. All must be chosen eventually, but the order is up to the player. In Edgar and Terra's scenario, the party merely fights their way through several enemies and eventually makes it to Narshe.</p><p>In Locke's scenario, Locke is in South Figaro. The town is crawling with Imperial Soldiers, so Locke steals some clothes to impersonate a merchant. He uses this disguise to infiltrate one of the buildings that the Imperial Soldiers are using as headquarters. Here, he steals some clothes from an Imperial Soldier, and traverses throughout the house. In the back, he finds Celes, a former general for the Empire who has been infused with artificial magical abilities. She has been labeled as a traitor, although trusting her throughout the game is always risky, and is referenced constantly. She agrees to join the Returners. The two manage to make it back to Narshe as well.</p><p>Sabin awakes near a house somewhere in the overworld. He meets Shadow, a ninja, whom is willing to accompany him, for a fee. They travel to the city of Doma, where they encounter an Imperial force. Kefka is there, and he impatiently wants to poison Doma's water supply as to speed up the occupation process. After General Leo leaves, Kefka follows through with his plan, despite direct orders from Leo not to go through with it. Everyone in the city except for Cyan dies. Cyan angrily leaves and begins to blindly attack at the enemies, hitting Sabin in the process. He apologizes, and the team agrees that they are there for the same reason; to dispose of the Empire. They proceed to escape by using the Magitek Armor that is in the camp (it is notable that this is the last time that the player can use Magitek Armor). After traveling for a while, the party comes upon a forest.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817059\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.8671875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817059\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Sabin and Cyan try to escape the Phantom Train</figcaption></figure><p>In the forest, they find a train. Hesitantly, they aboard the train (despite the warnings from Cyan). Once on board, it is revealed that the train is the Phantom Train; it passages the dead into their next life. After much battling, the party manages to make it off the train. Cyan then witnesses his wife and son boarding. Sadly, he cries for them, and blames himself for what happened in Doma. After making it to the small town of Mobliz, the party is introduced to a young boy known as Gau. He is rather insane, as he lives in the Veldt, a strip of land inhabited only by feral animals. The party befriends him, and he gives them his \"treasure,\" an underwater breathing apparatus. They use this to travel underwater. The party emerges in the town of Nikeah. In Nikeah, there is a port, which can take the party to Narshe. They board the boat, and manage to make it back to Narshe.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288279\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288279\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>The exterior of Figaro Castle</figcaption></figure><p>After reuniting in Narshe--along with new members Cyan, Gau, and Celes--the group prepares to defend the frozen Esper encountered in the beginning of the game. After holding off the Imperial forces long enough, however, Terra transforms into a strange pink form, and flies off. The party attempts to track her down, eventually finding her in the town of Zozo.</p><p>Here, she is being cared for by the Esper Ramuh, who tells them about the Espers, Magicite, and then implores them to infiltrate the Magitek Research Facility, where his friends are being tortured and drained of their power. To reach the facility, however, an airship is required. Setzer, a renowned thief, owns the only airship in the world. He has threatened to kidnap Maria, the star of an opera. Celes has an uncanny resemblance to Maria, so she poses as Maria.</p><p>Setzer holds up to his promise and kidnaps \"Maria,\" but the party comes along as well. Setzer finds this rather humorous and agrees to assist the party. After retrieving the Espers, including one named Maduin (who is Terra's father), the party returns to Zozo. The power of the Magicite that the Espers have transformed into shows Terra her past. Her mother stumbled into the Esper world long ago. One Esper took pity on her, Maduin, and the two fell in love. They had a child, Terra. Soon, however, Emperor Gestahl, Kefka, and the Imperial Forces make it into the Esper world. To wipe them out, the Espers do a magical spell to cleanse the world of any humans. Unfortunately, Terra and her mother are taken out as well. Emperor Gestahl notices Terra, and adopts her to be his warrior. After this flashback, Terra gains the ability to switch between her Esper and human forms.</p><p>After reuniting with Terra, the Returners decide that it is time for a final attack against the Empire. The Returners request Terra's assistance in asking the Espers for help. Terra does so, but the human world causes the Espers to attack violently, similarly to when Terra first transformed into an Esper. The Espers completely annihilate the capitol city of the Empire, Vector. Emperor Gestahl is astounded at the destruction caused by the Espers, so he requests an alliance between the Returners and the Empire. Locke and Terra are grouped with Shadow, Celes, and General Leo as they search for the Espers to lay out the terms of peace.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670328\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670328\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Emperor Gestahl makes peace with the Returners</figcaption></figure><p>Upon arriving at the town of Thamasa, the party finds that no one has any knowledge of Espers or magic, and the village's inhabitants act very hostile towards the party. The party discovers an elderly mage, Strago, who has knowledge of the Espers and magic (although he refuses to admit it). He eventually befriends the party and reveals that the village's inhabitants are all descendants of mages that fought in the War of the Magi. He recommends that the party go get some sleep. During the night, he rushes in shouting that one of the houses is on fire, and his granddaughter, Relm, is trapped inside. The party manages to rescue her, and the two join the party to search for the Espers. Soon enough, they find the Espers, and the peace terms are laid out by General Leo (who is unaware of the evil plans of Gestahl and Kefka). This peaceful gathering is quickly interrupted by Kefka. He absorbs the power from all of the Espers, and after resistance from Leo, promptly murders him.</p><p>The Returners are reunited, and by now, it is clear what Kefka and Emperor Gestahl's evil intentions are. They plan to resurrect the Floating Continent. To do so, they must go into the now open Esper world and collect the remains of the Warring Triad. They easily do so, and the island that the Esper world is located on rises into the sky: the Floating Continent.</p><p>Three statues are in place on the Floating Continent that provide perfect balance for the entire world. If moved even the slightest, the world could be reshaped and destroyed. Obviously, Kefka and Gestahl have evil intent. After fighting their way to Kefka and Gestahl, the party is all knocked unconscious except for Celes (whose allegiance is shaky). Kefka offers her a sword and commands her to kill the party. She refuses, and instead stabs Kefka. Kefka is angered by this, and he begins to use the magic that the statues are granting him. Gestahl is opposed to this, but is quickly disposed of by Kefka. Kefka then moves all of the statues around, causing what is best described as the end of the world.</p><p>Fortunately, the game does not end there. The second part of the game, the World of Ruin, begins with Celes awaking from a year-long coma. After awakening, she finds herself on an island under the care of Cid, who has become a fatherly figure to her. Cid reveals to Celes that he has become gravely ill and at that moment, the game leaves his fate in the player's hands. The player can choose to have Celes nurse Cid back to good health by catching and feeding him \"yummy\" or regular fish. Conversely, Cid can die by feeding him rotten fish or if Celes does not tend to his illness. If Cid dies, Celes will find a raft that he built so she could sail to freedom, but not before attempting suicide (which is referenced more in the Japanese version of the game). If Cid lives, he will show Celes the raft he was building and give it to her so she can leave the island. Regardless of whether Cid lives or dies, Celes will eventually set out to find all of her friends.</p><p>The World of Ruin is mostly non-linear (as opposed to the World of Balance), and after acquiring a certain amount of required party members, the player can proceed to Kefka's Tower, where he rules with an iron fist. Each character has a unique story during the World of Ruin, and while some are optional, it is definitely interesting to see where they have gone. In addition, each character has an optional side-quest that maximizes their power. Optional characters Umaro and Gogo and be obtained during the World of Ruin as well. After destroying the three statues housed inside, the party makes their way to Kefka. He has drained the Warring Triad of their power, so now he has godlike strength. He launches into a monologue, enraged that the world can still cling to hope, citing the World of Ruin as a reason why the party should just give up hope. After each of the party's members gives a personal example of why he or she still has hope, the final battle begins.</p><p>After the destruction of Kefka, it is revealed that all the Magicite that was in him helped keep magic in power. Destroying Kefka means the end of magic, meaning the potential destruction of Terra. As Terra helps the party escape in her Esper form, her father comes and tells her that if she can cling onto her human side, she may survive. The airship Falcon manages to catch her as she falls, and she survives: a human. The world is saved, Kefka has been defeated. A montage of clips from various portions of the world plays, showing how the citizens are rebuilding the world after the horror of Kefka's reign.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710531\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710531\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>All of the playable characters except for Shadow and Gau</figcaption></figure><p>Fourteen characters are fully playable in the game. They range from a little girl with a talent for painting to a full-grown yeti. While the plot initially forces the player to use certain characters at certain times, later sections of the game leave party creation largely to the player. Dialogue at certain plot points is entirely dependent on the player's chosen party composition. In this way, the game takes a significant step towards a more rewarding role-playing experience.</p><p>Each character has a back story significant to his or her development, if not to the main plot. The depth of the cast is commonly praised as a highlight of the game, and some character subplots are arguably more compelling than the main storyline. In the World of Ruin section, most characters have optional side-stories that delve into their histories and their psyches more deeply than the main story. For instance, in Cyan's side-quest, the party explores his subconsciousness, eventually freeing him from a captor demon. He meets the ghosts of his wife and child, and they encourage him to not hold himself responsible for the events that transpired in Doma. Each of these side-quests addresses a previously touched-upon attribute (personality trait, life event, etc.) of its central character.</p><h3>Terra Branford</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-417761\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 290px\" data-ratio=\"1.3793103448276\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-417761\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Terra Branford</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/terra-branford/3005-515\" data-ref-id=\"3005-515\">Terra</a> (Tina in the Japanese version) is a girl with mysterious origins whom the player are first introduced to in the beginning of the game. She is with a group of Imperial Soldiers as they search the town of Narshe for an Esper, which appears to have been recently uncovered in the mines of Narshe. The soldiers Terra is with discuss where she came from and one mentions that she makes him uncomfortable. The soldiers (and Terra) are in a powerful suit known as Magitek Armor that gives the wearer incredible defense, strength, stamina, health, and even powerful magic attacks. After the group finds the Esper, Terra reacts strangely to it and the group of soldiers with her disappear.</p><p>Later in the game, it is revealed that Terra is the daughter of an Esper named Maduin and a human mother named Madonna. Madonna somehow ended up in the Esper realm and Maduin fell in love with her. When Imperial Soldiers attempt to invade the Esper realm, Madonna and her baby girl are sucked back into the human realm, where Terra is raised by Emperor Gestahl. She is said to have destroyed fifty Imperial Soldiers in one exercise, so Gestahl controls her through an item called the Slave Crown (which is later removed by The Returners).</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Terra is found in the town of Mobliz, caring for all of the children who lost their parents when the Light of Judgment obliterated their town. Terra fears that she isn't powerful enough anymore, but when she annihilates a monster that comes to destroy the children, she gains courage and encourages the children to live for hope. She then joins the party to keep Kefka from causing the world anymore pain.</p><p>At one point in the game, Terra learns her special ability: Morph. This allows her to transform into an Esper and boosts her magic and physical attack. Her Esper form is a glowing pink figure with long hair. She can switch back and forth between it.</p><h3>Locke Cole</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11428\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.1297935103245\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11428\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Locke Cole</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/locke-cole/3005-516\" data-ref-id=\"3005-516\">Locke</a> (Lock in the Japanese version) is a young thief.

His special ability is Steal, which allows him to take items from certain enemies. A Relic, the Thief Glove, can turn this attack into Capture, in which Locke attacks and steals at the same time. In the beginning of the game, Locke vows to protect both Terra and Celes, and attempts to keep that promise at the best of his ability.</p><p>Locke was in love with a girl from Kohlingen named Rachel, who normally accompanied him on his treasure hunts. On one hunt, Rachel fell and suffered an injury that caused amnesia. She forgot that she loved Locke, but he stays anyway. He is eventually too heartbroken to stay any longer, so he leaves. During his absence, the Empire attacks, and Rachel is killed. Her father says that her final words were Locke's name. Locke is so hard on himself that he searches far and wide for a way to bring her back to life. He finds a Magicite known as Phoenix that is supposed to heal people from the dead. Since it is damaged, the effects are temporary, but Rachel tells Locke not to be too hard on himself, and that she loves him.</p><h3>Cyan Garamonde</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398517\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.2603076923077\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398517\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Cyan Garamonde</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/cyan-garamonde/3005-519\" data-ref-id=\"3005-519\">Cyan</a> (Cayenne in the Japanese version) is a loyal servant of the king of Doma.

The eight levels are selected via a time bar that slowly goes across the numbers. The SwdTech attacks do a variety of things, from multiple hits with Cyan's sword, to a one hit kill. Cyan typically speaks in Old English, saying things such as \"thou art\" or \"sayeth.\" This trait is poked fun at constantly throughout the game.</p><p>When Kefka poisons Doma's water supply, everyone close to Cyan perishes (including his wife, Elaine, and his son, Owain). Angry at the Empire, he joins the Returners, where he later meets Gau, his best friend.

He was originally a thief named Clyde, who traveled with friend and fellow thief Baram. During a heist of one million GP, Baram gets injured and requests that Clyde kills him.

In one of the most famous scenes in the game, Edgar flips a coin, and it is decided that he will inherit the crown. Later in the game (when Celes uses the same coin to trick Setzer into letting the party use his airship), it is revealed that he nobly used a double-sided coin so that his brother wouldn't have to rule Figaro.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Edgar disguises himself as a thief named Gerad, and keeps the disguise until he breaks into Figaro Castle. He then reveals that he is Edgar, and fights alongside the party.</p><h3>Sabin Rene Figaro</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11430\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 286px\" data-ratio=\"1.4440559440559\" data-width=\"286\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11430\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Sabin Rene Figaro</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/sabin-rene-figaro/3005-518\" data-ref-id=\"3005-518\">Sabin</a> (Mash in the Japanese version) is the aforementioned younger brother of Edgar Roni Figaro. He left his inheritance to the throne to train in martial arts under a man named Duncan. Sabin's special ability is Blitz. When selected, a control code must be inputted to do a certain attack. For example right, left, right would be the control code for the move Pummel. Sabin can learn more Blitzes throughout the game, which are increasingly complex.</p><p>Sabin wins the coin toss with Edgar (the one that Edgar rigged with a double-sided coin), so he leaves his inheritance and trains under a world famous Duncan Harcourt. Duncan's son, Vargas, becomes jealous when he realizes that Sabin is superior in martial arts, and that Duncan might leave the dojo to him. Vargas attempts to murder Sabin, and then escapes to Mount Koltz, where he is defeated by Sabin. He then proceeds to reunite with Edgar, and join the party.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Sabin is found in Tzen, holding up a building to keep the child inside from burning alive. After rescuing the child from inside, Sabin will join the party. However, if the time runs out, then Sabin is permanently dead.</p><h3>Celes Chere</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391757-ceres.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391757\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.3106060606061\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391757-ceres.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391757\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/391757-ceres.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/391757-ceres.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Celes Chere</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/celes-chere/3005-524\" data-ref-id=\"3005-524\">Celes</a> is a Magitek Knight, in that she is genetically fused with magic from birth.

She is accused of treason, and then tortured. After being rescued by Locke, she decides to join the Returners. Throughout the game, her loyalty is questioned constantly, but it remains true that she is on the same side with the Returners. She proves this when Kefka gives her a sword to attack the party with, but instead she attacks Kefka.</p><p>During the World of Ruin, she awakens from a year long coma under the care of Cid.

His special ability is Lore. He can learn attacks from enemies that the party has fought before, and then use them in battle. Not every spell can be learned in Lore, however. Strago is a descendant of the Mage Warriors, hence his natural magic abilities. His ancestors fought in the War of the Magi. Apparently, Relm is not Strago's actual granddaughter, but a 'friend's daughter.' It is hinted at during Shadow's flashbacks that he is the actual father of Relm.</p><p>After talking to Strago in Thamasa, everyone in the town becomes more friendly. The innkeeper lowers the price to sleep there from 1000GP to 1GP. Despite Strago denying any connection to magic or the Espers, it is eventually revealed that he indeed can use magic and has a knowledge of Espers. During the night, he asks the party to save his granddaughter, Relm, from a burning building. After rescuing her, Strago will join the party, and eventually Relm will as well.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Strago is first found in the Cult of Kefka. If Relm is in the party, however, he snaps out of his trance, and joins the party. Upon returning to Thamasa, one of Strago's friends fakes and injury and claims that it came from the beast Hidon, a monster that Strago spent almost his entire life chasing. His curiosity renewed, he goes to search again. After finding and defeated Hidon, Strago is the happiest he's ever been, and Relm thanks his friend for it.</p><h3>Relm Arrowny</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191847\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 202px\" data-ratio=\"1.490099009901\" data-width=\"202\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191847\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Relm Arrowny</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/relm-arrowny/3005-522\" data-ref-id=\"3005-522\">Relm</a> is a ten year old (although she is much smarter than an average ten year old) from Thamasa.

If the Relic Fake Mustache is attached to Relm, Sketch is replaced with Control, which allows the player to control the enemy that the attack is used on. It is hinted throughout the game that Shadow is Relm's actual father.</p><p>After Strago joins the player's party, Relm feels left out and follows the party into the Esper Cave. She helps out by sketching Ultros, and showing him that he actually is an ugly octopus. During the World of Ruin Relm can be found in one of two places. She can be found in the Cave in the Veldt if Shadow wasn't rescued, or she can be found in the mansion of Owzer, where she is being forced to paint. The painting she is making is possessed by a demon, and the party has to defeat it to get Relm back in the party.</p><h3>Setzer Gabbiani</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191778-setzer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191778\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 176px\" data-ratio=\"1.9034090909091\" data-width=\"176\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:190.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191778-setzer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191778\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4358/191778-setzer.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4358/191778-setzer.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Setzer Gabbiani</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/setzer-gabbiani/3005-520\" data-ref-id=\"3005-520\">Setzer</a> is an infamous gambler who appears to be an enemy character at first, but then turns out to be benign.

After being captured by Setzer, she bets her hand in marriage in trade for the use of Setzer's airship, the Blackjack. She uses the same double-sided coin that Edgar used to lose to his brother. Amused that he was beaten at his own game, Setzer joins the party and agrees to help the Returners.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, the Blackjack has been destroyed. Depressed, Setzer is found in a cafe. The party convinces him to join by showing their hope that the world will go back to normal. Setzer then uncovers the location of the Falcon, the only other airship in the world that belonged to his deceased friend Daryl.</p><h3>Gau</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398853-6_gau_a.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398853\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 195px\" data-ratio=\"1.7179487179487\" data-width=\"195\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:171.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398853-6_gau_a.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398853\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398853-6_gau_a.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398853-6_gau_a.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Gau</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/gau/3005-525\" data-ref-id=\"3005-525\">Gau</a> is a unique character that is found living among the animals in the Veldt.

One of the most notorious of all the Final Fantasy villains; he isn\u2019t a living incarnation of sin, or a supreme god-like being come to plunge the world into utter darkness. He is just an evil, evil man; one part coward, one part clown, one part mage, and one part nihilistic megalomaniac bent on world domination. His infamous cackle is one of the first things verbally spoken in a Final Fantasy game.</p><p>Kefka was born and immediately abandoned. He was raised in a Thamasa orphanage in which he was beaten often by the orphanage head. He developed a cold, quiet personality due to his early experiences. Kefka eventually migrated to Vector and entered the Imperial academy where he graduated at the top of his class. Cid immediately recognized his talents and took him on as an apprentice, putting him in prime position to be the first volunteer for the Magitek Knight program. He was genetically fused with magic through an imperfect program, but for years showed no signs of it affecting his sanity whatsoever.</p><p>He went on to become incredibly successful within the Empire, taking command of the Magitek Knights at only 23 years of age. It was then that he met Celes Chere, an orphaned citizen of Tzen, and took a liking to her. Celes became his apprentice and he pulled several strings to ensure that she became a Magitek Knight herself. Kefka's imperial career peaked at age 31 when he was made Imperial Prime Minister, a position second only to Emperor Gestahl himself. Kefka gained fame as a brilliant tactician and strategic savant. It was at this time that Kefka's sanity began to deteriorate, most likely due to imperfections in the original magic-infusing process he underwent from Cid.</p><p>At a banquet celebrating Celes' promotion to Rear Admiral, Kefka finally cracked with a violent outburst, and slid quickly into insanity afterward. Once shy and taciturn, Kefka began dressing in garish clown costumes and wearing makeup. Memories of his teenage and adult life began to fade away, leaving only his horrid childhood. Thus he became more cruel and more hateful and eventually developed a bloodlust and an obsession with destruction. Gestahl noticed this and removed him from the military.</p><p>However, Gestahl was still thankful to Kefka for his years of service beyond expectation and stellar military record, so Kefka was placed at the position of Court Mage. His former position was filled by General Leo, which sparked Kefka's intense jealousy and hatred of the man which culminates during the events of the game. Kefka's reputation among imperial soldiers is on display in the camp outside Doma castle during Sabin's scenario. He has a reputation as a coward, yet many of the imperial soldiers still fear him due to his being prone to wild fits of rage and violence.</p><p>Kefka is responsible for many of the game's events. He is the one who demands that a Slave Crown be put on Terra's head. He also is responsible for the poisoning of Doma's water supply; after General Leo takes too long to formulate an attack plan, Kefka decides to take matters into his own hands and poisons the water. He is also at the Magitek Research Facility, where he physically and mentally abuses Espers to suck them dry of their power. In a ploy later in the game, Emperor Gestahl puts Kefka in prison, claiming that his poisoning of Doma was unnecessary and cruel. After it is revealed to be an evil Imperial plot, Kefka comes to Thamasa where he turns the congregated Espers into Magicite.</p><p>Using that power, Kefka and Emperor Gestahl revive the Floating Continent, where statues that keep the world in balance reside. After the party reaches him, he freezes them all (except Celes) with power that he is getting from the statues. He then orders her to stab the party, and gives her a sword. Refusing, she stabs him instead. Kefka is annoyed and enraged, but not fatally wounded. He orders the statues to kill them all. Gestahl, afraid that Kefka is going to upset the gentle balance of the statues, shouts at him to stop. Kefka refuses, and then kills Gestahl and merely kicks his body off the edge of the Floating Continent. He then moves all of the statues around, reshaping the World of Balance into the World of Ruin.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Kefka is technically the \"god\" of the land. He rules with an iron fist from atop his perch in Kefka's Tower. If so little as one person opposes him, he destroys their entire town with the \"Light of Judgment.\" The effects of this are seen in several places, especially in Tzen and Mobliz. Followers of his have joined a cult called the Cult of Kefka. Members walk around mindlessly, and one villager says that there is no hope for them. However, Strago is seen with them, and he can be revived.</p><p>After reaching the top of Kefka's Tower, Kefka can't believe that the party can have so much hope in such a ruined world. They all use examples from their personal lives (and quests in the game). This angers Kefka, and he takes on his god form, which has several stages with multiple forms in each stage. After defeating him, the end of magic in the world is witnessed. Terra, being part Esper, was believed to be one of the casualties at first, but then she lands on the airship, alive and well.</p><h3>Emperor Gestahl</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-188595\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 167px\" data-ratio=\"1.1916167664671\" data-width=\"167\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-188595\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Emperor Gestahl</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/gestahl/3005-529\" data-ref-id=\"3005-529\">Gestahl</a> (he is Gastra in the Japanese version) is the ruler of the Empire. Gestahl has ruled the Empire ever since its beginning, and is obsessed with harnessing magical energy for aid in his military conquest. He once managed to infiltrate the Esper home world, but was quickly ejected from it (along with Terra and her mother). When the Espers realize that he is attempting to come into their home again, they break free of the gate, and--being unable to control their power at first--they completely obliterate the capital city of Vector. Amazed at their power, the Empire lay down their arms, and Kefka is thrown in jail for his crimes. It is, however, merely a ploy to get into the Esper home world. General Leo, the most noble general of the Empire, is kept out of the secret, however, so when he tries to protect the Espers, he is killed by Kefka.</p><p>Gestahl underestimates Kefka's own insanity, and ends up being murdered when he tries to stop him. He is shamed by Kefka when his dead body is disrespectfully knocked off the Floating Continent.</p><h3>Cid Del Norte Marguez</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391756\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 229px\" data-ratio=\"1.8646288209607\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:186.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391756\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Cid Del Norte Marguez</figcaption></figure><p>Cid is a recurring character in the Final Fantasy franchise. In this particular game, he is the head researcher of the Empire. His work led to several inventions, including Magitek Armor. He is referred to as a grandfather figure to Celes several times in the game, and when she joins the Returners, he begins having doubts about Emperor Gestahl and Kefka's plans. He helps the party by warning them about a trap in Vector and by helping them escape the Magitek Research Facility.</p><p>After the World of Balance is destroyed, Cid (and many others, including Celes) is stranded on a small island. It is subtly referenced that the others all committed suicide by jumping off a large cliff on the island (and Celes attempts to as well, once Cid dies). He cares for Celes for a year while she is in a coma, falling ill while he does so. Once Celes awakens, he dies, but not before revealing a raft that Celes can use to escape the island.</p><h3>General Leo Sharret Cristophe</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393786\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 289px\" data-ratio=\"1.681660899654\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:168.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393786\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>General Leo</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/general-leo/3005-4559\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4559\">General Leo</a> is one of the two head Imperial Generals (the other being Celes). Leo is more noble than other Imperial leaders, such as Kefka and Gestahl. He was assigned to capture Doma, but when he had to leave, Kefka took over and poisoned the water. He later apologizes to the only remaining survivor, Cyan. During the fake peace treaty between the Empire and the Returners, the fact that it isn't true is kept away from Leo. When the Espers meet to negotiate peace, he does the talking, and convinces them to have peace.</p><p>After Kefka reveals the plan as being fake, Leo bravely defends the Espers and the party. However, Kefka quickly destroys him using the powerful magic that he absorbed from the already dead Espers.</p><p>General Leo was subject to a famous rumor in the '90s. Much like Aerith Gainsborough of Final Fantasy VII, many fans claimed that there was indeed a way to bring Leo back from the demise he fell to at Kefka's hands. These were, however, proven incorrect as it is now confirmed that there is no way to bring back the fan favorite in the World of Ruin aside from altering the game's code.</p><h3>Ultros</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266058\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 179px\" data-ratio=\"0.73743016759777\" data-width=\"179\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266058\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultros</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/ultros/3005-530\" data-ref-id=\"3005-530\">Ultros</a> (he is Othros in the Japanese version) is a purple talking octopus who appears at many times during the game.

He is first encountered on the Lethe River, where he spouts out many of the catchphrases he is famous for. In the World of Ruin, he ends up owing too much money to the owner of the Colosseum.

He is playable for a small part of the game (when the party is on the Lethe River). His special ability is Health, which heals the entire party without using any magic points. After the destruction of the World of Balance, he is not encountered again.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The music of Final Fantasy VI was written by <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, who was well-known for his work in previous Final Fantasy games. He composed a theme song for every playable character. In addition to these themes, the soundtrack contains a traditional battle theme, multiple boss fight themes, songs for special events, and songs for several of the towns and other locales. A few tracks exceed ten minutes; these include \"Dancing Mad\", the seventeen minute-long final boss theme, and the \"Ending Theme\", which combines all of the individual character theme songs.</p><p>One of the game's most famous songs is \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\", a song that is played during the well-known opera scene. The sound chip of the SNES (SPC700 format sound chip) didn't allow for actual voice, so Uematsu created a synthesized voice that sang in rhythm to the song. Later in the SNES' life, some developers figured out how to do actual voice, however. In Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\" is sung in Italian by Svetla Krasteva.</p><p>There were many albums of Final Fantasy VI's music released. The original soundtrack was released on three discs in both North America (as Final Fantasy III: Kefka's Domain) and Japan (as Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version). Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale was an album that contained orchestral arrangements of Final Fantasy VI's music. Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VI featured music from the game preformed on piano by Reiko Nomura. Final Fantasy VI Special Tracks was an album that consisted of unused songs or remixed music. In addition, many of Final Fantasy VI's songs have been adapted by other bands (such as Nobuo Uematsu's own band The Black Mages, and the band Machinae Supremacy).</p><h3>Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712084\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.89\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712084\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Omen (4:15)</li><li>The Mines of Narshe (2:48)</li><li>Awakening (1:41)</li><li>Locke's Theme (2:01)</li><li>Battle (1:59)</li><li>Victory Fanfare (0:39)</li><li>Edgar and Sabin's Theme (2:32)</li><li>Kefka (2:43)</li><li>Mt.

It is the third game in the <a href=\"/metroid/3025-3\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3\">Metroid</a> franchise, and the plot picks up where the last game in the series, <a href=\"/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a>, left off.</p><p>Like most games of the series, Super Metroid is an 2D action-adventure game with platforming elements. Players take the role of a female bounty hunter known as <a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran</a> as she explores the deadly planet <a href=\"/zebes/3035-373\" data-ref-id=\"3035-373\">Zebes</a> and collect an arsenal of weapons and gadgets, which will in turn let her progress into areas that were previously inaccessible.</p><p>Super Metroid was one of the largest and most graphically-impressive games for the console at the time of its release. Even today, the game is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time.</p><p>Super Metroid is also famous for the unintentional ability to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">\"sequence break\"</a> the game. This means that although there is roughly a set path for Samus to follow, skilled players are capable of reaching ledges or getting past <a href=\"/barrier/3015-1522\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1522\">barriers</a> before they have discovered the power up that is ordinarily required to get there. For example, by mastering a maneuver known as the 'mockball' players can get the super missiles very early in the game, when they enter <a href=\"/brinstar/3035-1572\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1572\">Brinstar</a> for the first time. This curious mechanic has many people struggling to see who can find the fastest path to take to complete the game, making Super Metroid one of the first games surrounded by the <a href=\"/speedrun/3015-179\" data-ref-id=\"3015-179\">'speedrun'</a> phenomenon.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215607\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215607\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/215607-gfs_49897_1_6.jpg\"/></a><figcaption>The famous line</figcaption></figure><p>Super Metroid opens with a short summary of its predecessor, <a href=\"/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5708\">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> on the Nintendo <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>.

After exploring Norfair, Samus uses the Grapple Beam to gain access to the <a href=\"/wrecked-ship/3035-1573\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1573\">Wrecked Ship</a>. When she arrives the power is off and the place is deserted except for ghosts. Eventually she arrives in a room and the boss <a href=\"/phantoon/3005-3996\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3996\">Phantoon</a> appears. After defeating Phantoon, power returns to the ship allowing Samus to fully explore it. While exploring the ship she finds the Gravity Suit which will allow her to freely travel through water.</p><p>Samus then returns to Brinstar and uses a power bomb to break the glass tube separating Brinstar from <a href=\"/maridia/3035-1575\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1575\">Maridia</a>. With the Gravity Suit equipped Samus is able to explore the flooded Maridia fully. While in Maridia she defeats the sub-boss <a href=\"/botwoon/3005-9297\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9297\">Botwoon</a> and the boss <a href=\"/draygon/3005-3999\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3999\">Draygon</a>. Upon defeating Draygon Samus receives the Space Jump ability which will allow her access into Lower Norfair where <a href=\"/ridley/3005-1305\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1305\">Ridley</a> resides.</p><p>Shortly after entering lowering Norfair, Samus enters a battle with a Golden Torizo which is much more powerful than the previous Torizo she battled. After defeating it she receives her final power-up, the Screw Attack. After further traveling through Lower Norfair she eventually reaches Ridley's hideout. After defeating Ridley she enters the next room but finds that the Metroid Hatchling is not there.</p><p>After this she returns to Crateria and enters the room with the four golden statues of the bosses. The gems of the bosses break and the statues collapse granting Samus entrance into the Space Pirates base, <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a>. While traveling through Tourian, Samus reaches an area where the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> (now fully grown) comes out of nowhere and attacks an enemy. After killing the enemy it proceeds to attack Samus draining all of here energy tanks and leaving her with just one blip of energy.</p><p>After recovering at a nearby energy machine, Samus eventually confronts <a href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\">Mother Brain</a> who resides in her signature glass tube. Once Samus does enough damage to Mother Brain the tube collapses and Mother Brain reveals her true form. Halfway through the battle Mother Brain begins to drain all of Samus' energy using a beam attack. Before Mother Brain can unleash the killing blow the Metroid Hatchling appears and attacks her. While Mother Brain is stunned from the attacked the Hatchling begins to regenerates Samus' energy. However, Mother Brain recovers from her stunned state and begins to attack the Hatchling while it is in the process of helping Samus. Mother Brain deals a final blow to the Hatchling killing it, but right before it dies it uses the last bit of its strength to give Samus the power of the Phazon Beam which Samus uses to easily finish off Mother Brain.</p><p>After Mother Brain is defeated a <a href=\"/self-destruct-sequence/3015-423\" data-ref-id=\"3015-423\">self-destruct sequence</a> is activated and Samus has 3 minutes to get out of Tourian and escape planet <a href=\"/zebes/3035-373\" data-ref-id=\"3035-373\">Zebes</a> before it explodes. While on her way to her ship she stops to save the animals that helped her earlier in the game. Once she reaches her ship she takes off and while she is flying away Zebes is seen exploding in the background.</p><h2>Power Ups</h2><p>Samus' suit can be augmented with a number of <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power ups</a> that grant her new powers and abilities. Each element can be configured on or off in the suit equipment menu. There are a great deal of power ups to collect scattered throughout Zebes and each one that is collected, along with map squares discovered, increases the completion percentage which is displayed at the end of the game.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Power Up</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994591\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994591\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1994591-super_metroid_00002.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Energy Tank</figcaption></figure></td><td><a href=\"/energy-tank/3055-1926\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1926\">Energy tanks</a> increase Samus' maximum energy by 100 points.

It fires a single beam of incredible power, capable of destroying normal enemies with a single hit. It is received in the middle of the final boss fight with <a href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\">Mother Brain</a>. After the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> is killed by Mother Brain, it gives Samus the Hyper Beam before dying.</td></tr><tr><td>Murder Beam</td><td>The Murder Beam is an unofficial beam that can be obtained via a glitch in the game. It is obtained by equipping all five beams at once (usually the <a href=\"/plasma-beam/3055-1024\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1024\">Plasma Beam</a> and <a href=\"/spazer-beam/3055-1051\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1051\">Spazer Beam</a> can not be equipped together). In order to equip all five beams the player must first charge their beam, while the beam is charged they should go into the menu and equip all five beams. When fired, the Murder Beam produces an invisible wall of broken pixels rather than a sprite and the color is random. It is usually used during the Mother Brain fight as it is capable of killing her very quickly. Another interesting note is that the beam can only be fired to the left, if fired to the right the game will crash.</td></tr><tr><td>Space/Time Beam</td><td>The Space/Time Beam is another unofficial beam that can be obtained using a glitch. Instead of equipping all five beams at once, equipping the Spazer Beam, Plasma Beam, and Ice Beam together will produce the Space/Time Beam (Charge Beam can also be equipped though it is optional). The beam causes heavy lag and is registered as morph ball bomb damage when shot at enemies. The beam is best known for its ability to permanently corrupt the game, make strange alterations to the graphics, and produce several glitches such as resetting item pick-ups.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Abilities</b></h3><table><thead><tr><th>Ability</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-640107\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87222222222222\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-640107\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/640107-item_morph.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Morph Ball</figcaption></figure></td><td>The <a href=\"/morph-ball/3055-1049\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1049\">Morph Ball</a> gives Samus the ability to curl up into a ball in order to roll through small spaces.

Various techniques such as the mock ball have been used to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">sequence break</a> past large sections of the game and these techniques are vital in speedruns of the game. There are many opportunities to sequence break and many techniques that can be used to travel through the game at a much faster rate (i.e. shinesparking and spike jumping), because of this the game is speedran often and in many different ways. Speedruns can be run for 100% item completion, low% completion, any% completion, or for certain challenge runs such as beating the bosses in reverse order which requires very advanced techniques to complete.</p><p>Tool assisted speed runs are often much faster than there non-tool assisted equivalents. For example, currently the fastest non-tool assisted any% speedrun of the game is 44 minutes 54 seconds real time set on September 27, 2013 by Kottpower. The fastest any% tool assisted time is 38 minutes 41 seconds real time set on October 25, 2009 by Taco &amp; Kriole, nearly 8 minutes faster than the non-tool assisted run. The reason for the big time difference is because in a tool assisted run the runner plays the game one frame at a time and uses save states in order to create the perfect run. The runner also uses techniques that aren't humanly possible without playing the game at extremely slow speeds to save a lot of time. However, because the game is so popular in the speedrunning world, new ways to save time are being discovered which causes world record times to be broken.

Some are exploited in speedruns in order to <a href=\"/sequence-breaking/3015-980\" data-ref-id=\"3015-980\">sequence break</a> past areas of the game. However, only a small number of the glitches are actually used in speedruns and the majority of them are graphical glitches that are not useful to speedrunners. In addition, there are a small number of glitches that can freeze the game or permanently destroy the games SRAM ruining the cart. However, these type of glitches are very rare and almost impossible to perform on accident. Here are some of the more useful glitches used by speedrunners:</p><p>Mockball - The Mockball glitch allows Samus to retain her running speed while in morph ball form. This glitch can be used to get <a href=\"/super-missile/3055-1928\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1928\">super missiles</a> without having to face <a href=\"/spore-spawn/3005-3730\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3730\">Spore Spawn</a> which saves a lot of time.</p><p>Quick-charge - The quick-charge glitch allows Samus to charge up her shinespark over a much shorter distance. The glitch is useful in several areas as shinesparking allows the player to quickly dash through rooms, but it most notably allows the player to enter the <a href=\"/wrecked-ship/3035-1573\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1573\">Wrecked Ship</a> without collecting the <a href=\"/grapple-beam/3055-1053\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1053\">Grapple Beam</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023298\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023298\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/2023298-1.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event</figcaption></figure><p>Stand-up glitch - The stand-up glitch allows Samus to \"stand up\" in the <a href=\"/mother-brain/3005-1302\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1302\">Mother Brain</a> fight during the scripted scene where the <a href=\"/metroid-hatchling/3005-11454\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11454\">Metroid Hatchling</a> attacks Mother Brain, heals Samus while being attacked by Mother Brain, and then gives Samus the Hyper Beam after it is killed by Mother Brain. Usually Samus in incapacitated during this entire scene, but this glitch allows Samus to move around and attack Mother Brain during the scene allowing for a much quicker fight.</p><p>X-Ray Climb - The X-Ray Climb glitch allows Samus to get stuck in walls and travel outside of rooms without using doors. This glitch can be used to enter <a href=\"/tourian/3035-1576\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1576\">Tourian</a> without defeating any bosses, and obtaining a 6% completion percentage which is the lowest possible completion percentage.</p><h2>ROM Hacks</h2><p>Super Metroid is also frequently hacked primarily by using a program called SMILE (Super Metroid Integrated Level Editor). This allows fans of the game to change the games layout however they want whether they want to make small changes or completely change the layout. It also allows them to make graphical changes to give the game a fresh new look. These hacks are not commercial products, they are created and shared among fans of the game for free. They are, however, a big part of why the game still has a large player base almost 17 years after its original release. These hacks give players new ways to experience the game by providing different layouts to explore and, in some hacks, new graphics.</p><p>Many ROM hacks have been created by fans with the help of SMILE and there is a popular forum dedicated to Metroid hacks called <a href=\"http://forum.metroidconstruction.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metroid Construction</a>. At Metroid Construction users can share their created hacks with other members, provide feedback on certain hacks, ask hacking questions, and many other things.

At the time that Super Mario RPG was developed, Square and Nintendo had an excellent relationship, with Square making several great games on the <a href=\"/snes/3055-2795\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2795\">Super Nintendo</a> and <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>. Super Mario RPG was a more story-centered version of the Mario titles on the NES and Super Nintendo that came beforehand.</p><p>Super Mario RPG was added to Nintendo's digital download service on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>, the <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>, on Labor Day, September 1, 2008, in the United States. It was added to the Virtual Console in Europe on August 22, 2008, making Super Mario RPG available for the first time overseas. This happened during the Hanabi week, a release week Nintendo dedicates to games previously unreleased in Europe. The original Super Nintendo cartridge wouldn't work with import adapters available back then, so the game couldn't be played without an American Super Nintendo. Super Mario RPG costs the standard Super Nintendo price of 800 Nintendo Points to purchase the game (900 Nintendo Points in Europe). The game takes up 59 blocks of Wii Memory in the United States and 64 blocks of memory in Europe. The game is compatible with the Wii <a href=\"/classic-controller-support/3015-2522\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2522\">Classic Controller</a> and the Nintendo GameCube controller.</p><p>The changes made to the Wii version of the game from it's original Super NES release are few and fairly insignificant, but here is a short list of some of the changes or differences:</p><ul><li>There is more slowdown in the game, which is pretty significant in some portions, such as the boss fight with JJJ.</li><li>There are a few spots where one will see weird visual glitches, such as in battles where it will cover the main characters for a bit.</li><li>The Fire Wall attack from enemies has changed color. Instead of being red/orange and white it is now red and black/translucent.</li><li>The Mokuka enemy in Land's End can appear as a blue cloud instead of just white.</li><li>Timed Hits can be made harder to perform when playing with a Classic Controller due to the face buttons on the controller being raised higher. Thus it takes a longer amount of time for one to press the button down all the way. This can make timing harder to do if one is playing with the Classic Controller or Nintendo GameCube Controller.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Super Mario RPG is one of the most unique RPGs for its time, and is still unconventional today. This is due to the fact that Super Mario RPG incorporates <a href=\"/jump/3015-379\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jumping elements</a> into all aspects of its gameplay; from traversing the overworld, to fighting battles, the developers worked hard to make the game feel like a Mario game, and that meant a significant portion of the game needed to utilize the typical Mario gameplay of jumping. The gameplay is similar to that of later game Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga on the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>.</p><p>The game is seen from an <a href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric perspective</a> and the game gives the player the freedom to jump on objects. Not only does this allow one to reach places which can only be hit by jumping, but the game also has many hidden treasure chests strewn throughout the game. These chests can only be found by jumping into them from below, at which point they will appear and reward players with their contents.This is very typical of previous Mario titles, as invisible blocks would give the players rewards like stars.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229940-super_mario_rpg_battle_screenshot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229940\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.8671875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229940-super_mario_rpg_battle_screenshot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229940\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8757/229940-super_mario_rpg_battle_screenshot.png\"/></a><figcaption>A traditional battle. This particular battle is against the boss Belome.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike most RPGs of it's time, Super Mario RPG does not contain random battles. Instead, one can see enemies walking around on the overworld. If one touches them, a battle will take place on a separate battle screen. Naturally, this means one can avoid fighting. Battles are menu based, which makes the game feel like a typical RPG, but setting it apart are what the game dubs \" Timed Hits\". Timed Hits come into play when both attacking and defending in battle. When one attacks, whether it's with a normal attack or a \"Special Attack\", one can do more damage if one presses a button at just the right time. This also goes for defending against attacks from an enemy. This requires one to press the \"A button\" at the right time to reduce the effect of damage, or even take no damage at all.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229946-1024215527_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229946\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8757/229946-1024215527_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-229946\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8757/229946-1024215527_00.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8757/229946-1024215527_00.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>While walking around the overworld, enemies are visible.</figcaption></figure><p>Outside of those aspects, Super Mario RPG is a very conventional role-playing game (RPG). One traverses the world, both towns and \" <a href=\"/dungeon/3035-1131\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1131\">dungeons</a>\", chatting with <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">townsfolk</a>, taking part in a very large number of mini-games, fighting enemies and bosses to level up, purchase or find items and equipment to increase stats or help in a battle and keying story sequences to move the game's plot forward (although there are no \"cut-scenes\", most of the dialogue and story takes place within the game's text windows as various characters speak). It's also significant to note that Mario is mute in this game, although he will \"act out\" what he wants to say at certain points, often to hilarious effect; he will even morph into other characters, an unexplained phenomenon that is seen with indifference by in-game characters.</p><h3>Mini-Games</h3><p>Mini-games of all kinds can be found throughout Mario's adventure for the Seven Stars. Some of the mini-games are part of the story and one will experience them in one form or another before one can play them at a time of his choosing, while other mini-games are completely optional. In addition to the many mini-games, there are numerous side-quests that will reward one with items and equipment that can significantly help in Mario's adventure.</p><p><b>Melody Bay</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/688560-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.061.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-688560\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/688560-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.061.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-688560\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/688560-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.061.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/688560-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.061.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Playing the Melody Bay minigame</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Price: Free</li><li>Prizes: Alto Card, Tenor Card and Soprano Card</li></ul><p>Melody Bay can be found at Tadpole Pond and allows the player to compose \"songs\" by jumping on tadpoles that represent different notes (stand on the rock in front of the music lines to summon them) and each make a different sound (Mi, Do, So, Do, Re, La, Ti, Do).

A small handful of Spineys will also pop out of the pipes. If one smashes a Goomba, a point if given. If one smashes a Spiney, three points shall be taken.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687882-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687882\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687882-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687882\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/687882-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.026.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/687882-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.026.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Mushroom Derby Racing</figcaption></figure><p><b>Mushroom Derby Racing</b></p><ul><li>Price: 3 Cookies</li><li>Prizes: 3 Yoshi Cookie Items, the ability to race other Yoshis.</li></ul><p>One will find the Mushroom Derby in Yo'ster Isle.

A timer in the upper right keeps track of how long it takes one to reach the end of the track. The track has a general path although one will encounter side rides one can enter by holding right or left when one passes by them as well as turns in which one will need to break to avoid going off the track. If one goes off the track it takes a bit for Mario to return to the track, thus cutting down finish time. Twice one will enter a side-scrolling section which plays much differently than the 3D parts as there are platforming elements. As one goes through the track one can collect coins as well as Mushrooms, which one uses to boost. Initially one will play this mini-game as part of the story, and whatever time is gotten is the time one will need to beat in order to earn more coins when the mini-game is opened later on as a game the player can play anytime at a cost of 10 Coins. Beat the previous time to earn coins. If the player wagers 30 coins and beats the old time, the player earns 50 coins.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817430-beetlemaina.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817430\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817430-beetlemaina.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817430\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/817430-beetlemaina.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/817430-beetlemaina.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Beetle Mania</figcaption></figure><p><b>Beetle Mania (Listed as \"Game\" on the Menu when it is obtained)</b></p><ul><li>Cost: 500 Coins to purchase the Game Boy, free to play afterward</li><li>Prizes: Coins for Male and Female Beetles, a Frog Coin per Golden Beetle</li></ul><p>Beetle Mania is a shooter in which the player controls a Beetle who can move left and right along the bottom of a static screen as Koopa Shells fall in from all angles from above.

Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped by Bowser and Mario must fight his way through his castle to bring her back. During this highly familiar sequence, Mario fights and defeats Bowser. Right as Mario is about to claim victory and return home with the princess, a huge magical sword named Exor crashes through the castle, sending all parties flying off into the horizon. The crash flings Mario into the Warp Pipe on the roof of his house. Toad, distraught that Mario did not return with the Princess, urges Mario to return to Bowser's Keep. When he returns, he finds Exor has claimed the castle as Smithy Gang headquarters and their plan is take over the world. Smashing the bridge to Bowser's castle, Mario has to find another way around.</p><p>Mario returns home and he and Toad go to inform the Chancellor of what has happened. After talking to him, Mario runs into Mallow, who introduces himself as a frog from Tadpole Pond. He asks for Mario's help in getting his Frog Coin back from a thief called Croco. The two defeat him and return to the Mushroom Kingdom, where they find the Mushroom Kingdom taken over by Smithy's Gang. They save the townspeople and enter the castle, running into Mack, one of Smithy's lackeys, in the throne room. Defeating him, Mario receives a Star Piece, not sure what it is. With his resolve to save Princess Toadstool restored, Mario sets off with Mallow to uncover what the Star Piece means by talking to Mallow's Grandfather, Frogfucious.</p><p>The duo travels through the Kero Sewers, defeating Belome, and barrels down the Midas River. When Mario and Mallow reach Frogfucious at Tadpole Pond, he reveals that he is not really Mallow's grandfather and his real parents are out there somewhere. With another new mission, the two set off to Rose Town. Meanwhile, Bowser and what remains of his minions meet up and proclaim they will take back Bowser's Castle.</p><p>When Mario gets to Rose Town, they find the town under attack by paralyzing arrows. Looking for clues to what's happening, the party finds shelter in an inn and run into a little boy who plays with dolls. During playtime, one of the dolls, Geno, knocks out Mario and the party has to stay the night. In the middle of the night, a star gives Geno life and he walks into the Forest Maze to find and stop the source of the arrows.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Super Mario</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687936-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.008.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687936\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/687936-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.008.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687936\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/687936-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.008.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/687936-super_mario_rpg___legend_of_the_seven_stars.008.png\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Mario</figcaption></figure><p>After being flung from <a href=\"/bowsers-castle/3035-685\" data-ref-id=\"3035-685\">Bowser's keep</a>, Mario tries to return, only to find that a <a href=\"/exor/3005-7302\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7302\">large sword</a> now sticking out of the keep will have none of it.

Much of the game's charm and comedy come from Mario himself, whom despite his silence, has a wide range of funny and expressive animations. Much of the humor works in a very slapstick manner, such as Mario's often violent expressions, characters' prat-falls when an obvious point is made, and the constant bumbling actions by the game's many npcs.</p><p>The game also pokes fun at its protagonist and video game semblances to humorous effect.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1023772-callmegeno.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023772\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 240px\" data-ratio=\"0.8625\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1023772-callmegeno.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023772\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1023772-callmegeno.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1023772-callmegeno.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Geno is actually a doll.</figcaption></figure><p>One example of this is when Geno is first encountered; he is just one \"action figure\" in a line-up of action figures that includes Mario, Bowser and Princess Peach. A young child, Gaz, is playing with them in the Rosetown Inn and when he discovers that Mario is \"THE MARIO\" (which is proved by an elaborate jump, something that happens throughout the game in order for Mario to \"prove\" who he really is), he asks that Mario join him. What proceeds is Gaz playing with Mario as Gaz and Mario exchange \"blows.\" In the end, Mario gets \"knocked out\" from a super attack that Gaz unleashed on him with his \"secret weapon\", the Geno doll.</p><h2>Special Items</h2><p>There are a number of secret challenges in the game, and once Mario completes them he will get special Items.</p><h3>Attack Scarf</h3><p>In Monstro town an NPC will challenge Mario to complete over 30 jumps. This is a reference to Mario's special 'Super Jump' and 'Ultra Jump' abilities. Once 30 jumps is completed return to the NPC and he/she will reward him with the Attack Scarf accessory.</p><h3>Super Suit</h3><p>Perhaps the most difficult item in the game to obtain. Similar to the Attack Scarf, the Super Suit can be obtained if Mario completes 100 successful jumps with the 'Super Jump' or 'Ultra Jump' ability. When he has completed this task he can return to the NPC in Monstro town, and claim his prize. This item vastly increases attack level, and defense level.</p><h2>Cameos</h2><p>During the course of the game, many <a href=\"/easter-egg/3015-2\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2\">Easter eggs</a> and <a href=\"/cameo-appearance/3015-1014\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1014\">hidden characters</a> are available to encounter.</p><h3>Samus Aran Cameo</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/208706-ss_smrpg_samus2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208706\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/208706-ss_smrpg_samus2.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208706\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/208706-ss_smrpg_samus2.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5911/208706-ss_smrpg_samus2.gif\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Samus Aran in the Mushroom Kingdom</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/samus-aran/3005-99\" data-ref-id=\"3005-99\">Samus Aran</a> is located in two places in Super Mario RPG.

Upon speaking with her, she will say that she is resting up for Mother Brain.</p><h3>Link Cameo</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1295123-link.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295123\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1295123-link.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295123\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1295123-link.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1295123-link.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Link's cameo in Super Mario RPG</figcaption></figure><p>After getting the third star, <a href=\"/link/3005-191\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a> will be in Rosetown's inn.

There is a sealed door there that can be opened with the Shiny Stone. In Moleville, there is a person who will sell the party fireworks. After purchasing some, the party must go outside to where there are five crates and a little girl mole sitting down. She is willing to trade her Shiny Stone for the party's fireworks.</p><p>Culex is a throw-back to <a href=\"/angelic-bosses/3015-2231\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2231\">classic Final Fantasy bosses</a>, and is the hardest boss in the game, even more so then the <a href=\"/final-boss/3015-1537\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1537\">final boss</a> <a href=\"/smithy/3005-1730\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1730\">Smithy</a>. Culex is described as a Dark Knight from Vanda, and he has crossed over to Mario's realm in order to defeat the Dark Mage. Culex is not able to stay in Mario's world for long, for if he does it will lead to his destruction. Before Culex departs, he wishes to battle the strongest knight of the world.</p><p>While fighting Culex, the boss battle theme from <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a> plays, and upon defeating Culex the pre- <a href=\"/final-fantasy-vii/3030-13053\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13053\">Final Fantasy VII</a> victory theme plays. There are also other references to Final Fantasy in the game, but Culex is the most prominent. Upon defeat, Culex rewards the player with the Quartz Charm and departs.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The soundtrack to Super Mario RPG was a collaboration between <a href=\"/yoko-shimomura/3040-54084\" data-ref-id=\"3040-54084\">Yoko Shimomura</a> and <a href=\"/koji-kondo/3040-606\" data-ref-id=\"3040-606\">Koji Kondo</a>. <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a> also appears on the soundtrack, composing the <a href=\"/culex/3005-13871\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13871\">Culex</a> songs. It was released in Japan on March 25th, 1996 by NTT Publishing.</p><h3>Super Mario RPG Original Sound Version</h3><p>Total length: 53:37</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4495/242379-smr.png.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242379\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4495/242379-smr.png.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242379\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4495/242379-smr.png.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4495/242379-smr.png.jpg\"/></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Mario RPG Original Sound Version</figcaption></figure><p><b>Disc 1:</b></p><ol><li>Happy Adventure, Delightful Adventure</li><li>Let's Try</li><li>In the Flower Garden</li><li>Koopa Castle (First Time)</li><li>Fight Against Koopa</li><li>The Sword Descends and the Stars Scatter</li><li>Super Pipe House</li><li>Where Am I Going?</li><li>The Road Is Full of Dangers</li><li>Fight Against Monsters</li><li>Victory!!</li><li>Hello, Happy Kingdom</li><li>Explanation!</li><li>A New Partner</li><li>Still, the Road Is Full of Dangers</li><li>Invincible Star</li><li>Fight Against a Somewhat Stronger Monster</li><li>Here's Some Weapons!</li><li>Fight Against an Armed Boss</li><li>Got a Star Piece</li><li>The Dungeon Is Full of Monsters</li><li>Let's Go Down the Wine River</li><li>Grandpa and the Delightful Tadpoles</li><li>Shock!</li><li>Song about Tossing.</li><li>Let's Play \"Geno\"</li><li>Mount Sploogemore.</li><li>Beware the Forest's Mushrooms</li><li>Rose Town</li><li>From Inside the Earthen Pipe</li><li>Welcome!
